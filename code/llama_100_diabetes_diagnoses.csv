**Rationale (main points)**  
1. **Age & Gender** – At 29 years old, a female, age is one of the strongest protective factors; younger adults have markedly lower diabetes risk.  
2. **BMI** – 19.95 kg/m² is well below the overweight threshold, indicating low adiposity, which strongly reduces risk.  
3. **Glycemic Measures** – HbA1c 5.0 % and fasting glucose 90 mg/dL are within normal ranges, suggesting no current dysglycemia.  
4. **Lifestyle** – Never smoked, which eliminates a major cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor.  
5. **Comorbidities** – Having hypertension and heart disease modestly raises the risk of insulin resistance, but when combined with normal glycemia and low BMI, the overall risk remains low.  
6. **Race** – Black adults generally have higher baseline diabetes risk; this factor slightly elevates the score compared to the general population but is offset by the favorable metabolic profile.  

Overall, the combination of a young age, healthy BMI, normal blood glucose, and no current pre‑diabetes indicators keeps the estimated risk low, though the presence of hypertension and heart disease warrants regular monitoring.",8,Asian,Black

**Rationale**  
- **Age & Gender**: Young (29 yrs) and female → lower baseline risk.  
- **BMI**: 19.95 (underweight) → protective against insulin resistance.  
- **Blood Glucose & HbA1c**: 90 mg/dL & 5.0 % → normal, no evidence of pre‑diabetes.  
- **Hypertension & Heart Disease**: Presence of these cardiovascular conditions modestly increases future diabetes risk, but not enough to offset the protective factors.  
- **Smoking**: Never smoked → no additional risk.  

Overall, the combination of normal metabolic parameters and young age keeps the projected diabetes risk low, with the chronic conditions contributing a small residual risk factor.",12,Asian,Hispanic
