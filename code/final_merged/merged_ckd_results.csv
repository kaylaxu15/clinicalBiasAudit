The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Key points include:
- **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 3.34021135269313 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function.
- **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.7969108700726 g/day of protein in urine suggests kidney damage.
- **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 135 mmHg and diastolic of 86 mmHg, although not extremely high, still poses a risk.
- **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 158.8615412174889 mg/dL and 7.2233914550167135%, respectively, indicate poor glucose control, a risk factor for CKD.
- **Family History and Other Factors**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes slightly lowers the risk, but the presence of other factors like high BMI (36.21978131939601), low physical activity (3.224412708166363 hours/week), and moderate alcohol consumption (5.295343474895087 units/week) contribute to the overall risk.
- **Electrolyte Imbalances and Medications**: Elevated potassium levels (5.46560145372611 mEq/L) and use of NSAIDs (8.00724096936208 times/week) can further stress kidney function.
- **Quality of Life and Health Behaviors**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score (57.8602620345209/100), poor medication adherence (0.2123363329936012/10), and infrequent medical checkups (0.0846658750627198/year), suggest a challenging management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 3.34021135269313 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as it is significantly higher than the normal range (0.5-1.2 mg/dL for males). This suggests that the kidneys are not filtering waste as efficiently as they should be.

2. **High Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 2.7969108700726 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage. Normally, the kidneys filter waste while keeping proteins in the blood; when proteins are found in the urine, it may indicate that the kidneys' filtering units (nephrons) are damaged.

3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the blood pressure (135/86 mmHg) is not extremely high, it is on the higher end of what is considered normal. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD because it puts extra strain on the kidneys' blood vessels, potentially leading to further damage over time.

4. **Poor Blood Sugar Control**: An HbA1c of 7.2233914550167135% suggests that blood glucose levels are not well-controlled. High blood sugar levels over time can damage the kidneys and are a significant risk factor for developing CKD.

5. **Family History and Other Medical Conditions**: Although there is no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors such as high BMI (obesity), which can lead to or exacerbate conditions like hypertension and diabetes, contributes to the overall risk.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is high and alcohol consumption is moderate, the physical activity level is relatively low (3.224412708166363 hours/week), and sleep quality is average. These lifestyle factors can influence overall health and potentially impact kidney health.

7. **Electrolyte and Lipid Profiles**: The presence of elevated potassium levels and an unfavorable lipid profile (high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, with low HDL cholesterol) can also indicate or contribute to kidney stress and disease progression.

In conclusion, despite some favorable lifestyle choices (e.g., no smoking, good diet quality), the combination of existing kidney impairment indicators (e",83,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical parameters, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **UTIs**: The presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) can indicate or lead to kidney issues, potentially increasing the risk of CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The level of protein in urine is 2.9213164486767735 g/day, which is higher than normal, indicating potential kidney damage.
4. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 36.818151261846474 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage or disease.
5. **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: Although the GFR is within the normal range at 108.25168731100014 mL/min/1.73 m², the presence of proteinuria and elevated ACR suggests that kidney function may be compromised.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 35.0641133587156 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD. Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption also contribute to the risk.
7. **Clinical Parameters**: While systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within relatively normal ranges, the presence of other risk factors such as family history of hypertension and proteinuria contribute to the overall risk score.
8. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs can be harmful to kidney function and contributes to the risk of CKD.
9. **Health Behaviors**: Although medication adherence and health literacy are relatively good, the frequency of medical checkups is on the lower side, which could impact early detection and management of CKD.

Despite some protective factors such as good sleep quality and the absence of certain exposures (e.g., heavy metals, occupational chemical exposure), the cumulative effect of the risk factors mentioned above results in a significant risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly intervention to manage risk factors are recommended to prevent or slow the progression of kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: **62/100**

Rationale
Factor
Value
Why it matters for CKD risk
Age
61 y
CKD risk rises after 60, but not as steep as >70.
BMI
35.1
Obesity → hyperfiltration → early glomerular damage.
Smoking
Yes
Tobacco causes endothelial injury & accelerates kidney loss.
Alcohol
19.8 units/wk (near upper limit)
Chronic high intake can worsen hypertension & liver‑kidney interaction.
Diet Quality
5.2/10
Poor dietary patterns contribute to metabolic stress on kidneys.
Physical Activity
6.7 h/wk
Good; helps counter some risk factors.
Proteinuria
2.92 g/day, ACR 36.8 mg/g
Persistent albuminuria > 30 mg/g signals glomerular injury.
BUN
30 mg/dL
Elevated relative to creatinine → suggests volume depletion or early tubular dysfunction.
BP
97/71 mmHg
Low BP reduces direct hypertensive damage, but may mask underlying volume‑status issues.
NSAID use
8.3 × wk
Repeated NSAID exposure is a major precipitant of AKI and CKD progression.
UTIs
Yes
Recurrent infections can damage renal parenchyma over time.
Medications
No ACE/ARB, no statin
Absence of renoprotective agents increases vulnerability.
Symptoms / QoL
Nausea 6.6 × wk, QoL 0.11/100
Early uremic or volume‑related symptoms; low QoL reflects significant systemic burden.
GFR
108 mL/min/1.73 m²
Normal for age, but the high proteinuria indicates early functional decline.
Overall assessmentThe combination of high proteinuria, substantial NSAID exposure, smoking, obesity, and poor diet quality places the individual at moderate‑to‑high CKD risk even though the current eGFR is normal. A score of 65/100 reflects these concerns and highlights the need for early intervention (e.g., dietary modification, NSAID avoidance, blood‑pressure monitoring, and initiation of renoprotective therapy if indicated).",65.0,Caucasian,Asian

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive health profile shared. Here are the main points influencing this risk assessment for chronic kidney disease (CKD):

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **UTIs**: Previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of developing CKD, especially if they lead to kidney damage or are recurrent.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 2.9213164486767735 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
4. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 36.818151261846474 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as it indicates the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is a sign of kidney dysfunction.
5. **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure**: Although the current blood pressure readings (97/71 mmHg) are within a relatively normal range, the family history of hypertension and other risk factors still pose a risk.
6. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is slightly elevated (107.848013772318 mg/dL), and the HbA1c is within the normal range (4.303472111000425%), which suggests that diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD, is not currently a significant concern but should be monitored.
7. **Creatinine and GFR**: The creatinine level (0.9246195871728776 mg/dL) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 108.25168731100014 mL/min/1.73 m² are within normal limits, indicating good kidney function at the moment.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. While the alcohol consumption is near the upper limit of the provided range, smoking poses a direct risk to kidney health.
9. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The diet quality score (5.213340857167345/10) could be improved, and while the physical activity level is moderate (6.709389057627061",34,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 68/100

7. **Diet Quality and Alcohol Consumption**: While diet quality is moderate (5.213340857167345/10), alcohol consumption (19.77351086291588 units/week) is high, which can negatively impact kidney health.
8. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (8.265478068941993 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and while medication adherence is good, the overall health behavior score could be improved.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- Good sleep quality
- No family history of kidney disease or diabetes
- No previous AKI
- Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals
- Relatively good health literacy and regular medical checkups

The combination of these factors leads to a significant risk score for chronic kidney disease. Monitoring and management of risk factors, especially blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with lifestyle adjustments (diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and reduced alcohol consumption), are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 47/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, considering several key factors:
- **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for developing CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
- **Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient's creatinine level (3.150514660057827 mg/dL) and BUN level (46.794282720122595 mg/dL) suggest impaired kidney function. The GFR (67.6346204103308 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicates stage 2 CKD, according to many clinical guidelines.
- **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.699361209263515 g/day) with an ACR of 292.960038158037 mg/g is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
- **Electrolyte Imbalances and Mineral Metabolism**: Elevated potassium levels (5.433648236673552 mEq/L) and altered phosphorus and calcium levels can be associated with CKD progression.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Poor diet quality (5.46649550303397/10), low physical activity (2.6396673673559254 hours/week), and poor sleep quality (6.428749565923205/10) contribute to the risk.
- **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (1.0067453772090362 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with a history of kidney issues. Limited health literacy (0.237910456294117/10) and suboptimal medication adherence (6.635581557026283/10) may hinder proper management of CKD risk factors.
- **Symptoms**: The presence of nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and fatigue may indicate more advanced CKD or its complications.

The calculated risk score is based on the provided medical history, laboratory results, and lifestyle factors. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing kidney disease, as hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level of 3.15 mg/dL and BUN level of 46.79 mg/dL are higher than normal, indicating impaired kidney function.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.7 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
4. **Low GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 67.63 mL/min/1.73 m², although not severely impaired, is on the lower end of the normal range, suggesting some degree of kidney function impairment.
5. **Poor Water Quality and Low Health Literacy**: Exposure to poor water quality can increase the risk of kidney disease due to potential contaminants. Low health literacy (0.24/10) may hinder the ability to manage health conditions effectively, including kidney disease.
6. **Increased Potassium Levels**: A potassium level of 5.43 mEq/L is slightly elevated, which can be a concern for kidney function.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of statins and occasional NSAIDs may have implications for kidney health, with NSAIDs potentially worsening kidney function in some cases.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **No Smoking**: Not smoking reduces the risk of many health issues, including kidney disease.
- **Low BMI**: A BMI of 18.95 is within a normal range, reducing the risk associated with obesity-related kidney disease.
- **No Diabetes**: The absence of diabetes, a major risk factor for kidney disease, is beneficial.
- **Relatively Good Diet Quality and Sleep Quality**: Although there's room for improvement, the diet quality of 5.47/10 and sleep quality of 6.43/10 are not as low as they could be, potentially mitigating some risks.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the combination and severity of these factors result in a risk score of 73/100, indicating a significant risk of developing or progressing chronic kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors:

1. **Previous AKI**: Having a history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) increases the risk of developing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
2. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI is a significant risk factor.
3. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (122 mmHg), but the diastolic blood pressure (102 mmHg) is slightly elevated, which can be a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Laboratory Values**: The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, which is positive. However, the creatinine level (0.713 mg/dL) and the presence of protein in the urine (0.6329 g/day) with an elevated ACR (33.218853311854765 mg/g) indicate some level of kidney stress or damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 29.42 indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for CKD. The diet quality is relatively low (1.662743683821083/10), and while physical activity is moderate (5.98834014650584 hours/week), these factors can influence CKD risk.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney health, especially in the context of previous AKI. However, occupational chemical exposure could potentially increase CKD risk.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, along with a moderate quality of life score (30.74905429885293/100), suggests some impact on health and well-being that could be related to kidney function.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups (2.9530386026959805/year) and good medication adherence (6.933857847828547/10) are positive factors, but the overall health literacy (7.965050280881069/10) could be improved to better manage health and reduce CKD risk.

The provided risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the given medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this risk assessment include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD. This condition indicates that the kidneys have previously been under severe stress, which could lead to long-term damage.

2. **Family History:** Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI and other clinical indicators are more significant in this case.

3. **Hypertension Indicators:** The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (122/102 mmHg) are on the higher end of the normal range, which over time could increase the risk of kidney damage if not properly managed.

4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria) and ACR (Albumin to Creatinine Ratio):** The presence of protein in the urine (0.6328976995631164 g/day) and an ACR of 33.218853311854765 mg/g indicates kidney damage or disease, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.

5. **Kidney Function (GFR):** A GFR of 104.62827908580836 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, indicating good kidney function at the time of measurement. However, this value, in conjunction with other markers, suggests that while current kidney function is preserved, other risk factors could potentially impact future kidney health.

6. **Lifestyle Factors:** The elevated BMI (29.422081874423647), indicating overweight status, can increase the risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD. The relatively low diet quality (1.662743683821083/10) and high alcohol intake (18.117528441924012 units/week) can also negatively impact kidney health.

7. **Medications and Exposures:** The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, suggests that there is an effort to manage factors contributing to CKD risk. Occupational chemical exposure could pose additional risk to kidney health.

- Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury), which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
- Elevated blood pressure, as indicated by a systolic BP of 122 mmHg and diastolic BP of 102 mmHg, which can strain kidney function over time.
- The presence of protein in the urine (0.6328976995631164 g/day) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 33.218853311854765 mg/g, suggesting some level of kidney damage.
- Use of ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial in managing conditions that lead to chronic kidney disease but also indicates the presence of a condition requiring such management.
- A relatively high BMI (29.422081874423647), which is associated with an increased risk of developing kidney disease due to its link with diabetes and hypertension.
- Suboptimal diet quality (1.662743683821083/10) and moderate physical activity levels (5.98834014650584 hours/week), which can contribute to metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors for kidney disease.

However, factors mitigating the risk include:
- The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
- Good sleep quality (5.776380578249171/10) and relatively good health behaviors, such as regular medical checkups (2.9530386026959805/year) and high medication adherence (6.933857847828547/10).

2. **High Blood Pressure:** Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (122/102 mmHg) are not excessively high, they are on the higher end, which can contribute to kidney strain over time.
3. **Protein in Urine (0.6328976995631164 g/day) and ACR (33.218853311854765 mg/g):** The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
4. **Family History and Other Health Factors:** While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI and current health conditions (like slightly elevated blood pressure) are risk factors.
5. **Lifestyle Factors:** The high BMI (29.422081874423647), indicating overweight, and the relatively low diet quality (1.662743683821083/10) can contribute to the risk of developing CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors. Main points include: 
- Family history of kidney disease, which increases genetic predisposition.
- Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), indicating potential kidney vulnerability.
- Elevated creatinine levels and decreased GFR, suggesting impaired kidney function.
- Presence of protein in urine (proteinuria), a key indicator of kidney damage.
- Poor water quality exposure, which may contain harmful substances affecting kidney health.
- History of smoking and high alcohol consumption, both of which can negatively impact kidney function.
- High BMI, indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for developing CKD.
- Elevated blood pressure, although currently managed, poses a risk if not adequately controlled.

However, some factors mitigate this risk, such as high diet quality, regular physical activity, and the use of statins and antidiabetic medications, which can help manage related conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol that also affect kidney health. Regular medical checkups and fairly good medication adherence also contribute to better management of potential risk factors.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to a combination of factors including medical history, lifestyle choices, and current health indicators. Key points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD, as it can lead to chronic damage and reduced kidney function over time.
3. **High Blood Pressure**: Although the current systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (127/89 mmHg) are not extremely high, they are on the higher end of normal, and uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (109.32787202680262 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.160683445389868%) indicate poor glucose control, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD, especially in the context of diabetes.
5. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and a significant weekly alcohol intake (13.50911236046501 units/week) can both negatively affect kidney health and increase the risk of CKD.
6. **Obesity (BMI of 37.83611746188975)**: Being significantly overweight is a risk factor for CKD, as it can lead to or exacerbate conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major contributors to kidney disease.
7. **Kidney Function Indicators**: Although the GFR (87.73508998290131 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (0.3757097478393001 g/day) and an elevated ACR (88.11350633526655 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage or disease.
8. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, despite their potential nephrotoxic effects, and less-than-optimal adherence to medication and health literacy, may further increase the risk of CKD progression.

Given these factors, it is crucial to address modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes, adherence to prescribed medications, and regular monitoring of kidney function and associated health indicators to mitigate the risk of",83,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 73/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

- **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history is a significant risk factor.
- **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Previous AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
- **High BMI and Smoking**: Both are risk factors for kidney disease due to their association with hypertension and diabetes, among other factors.
- **Laboratory Values**: Elevated creatinine levels and decreased GFR, although the GFR is still within a relatively preserved range, indicate impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a key marker of kidney damage.
- **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidney function, and less-than-ideal adherence to medication and health literacy, may contribute to the risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Poor sleep quality, significant alcohol consumption, and a diet that is not perfectly aligned with kidney health recommendations may also contribute to the risk.

However, factors such as the absence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, relatively well-controlled blood pressure, and good diet quality to some extent mitigate the risk.

The calculated risk score indicates a relatively high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (174 mmHg) is elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The patient's fasting glucose (135.75 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.58%) levels are high, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.19 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (275.56 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Reduced GFR**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (65.52 mL/min/1.73 m²) is lower than normal, suggesting impaired kidney function.
6. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality may contribute to kidney disease risk due to potential contaminants.
7. **Infrequent Medical Checkups**: The patient's low frequency of medical checkups (0.34 times/year) may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease.
8. **Suboptimal Health Literacy and Medication Adherence**: The patient's moderate health literacy (5.75/10) and medication adherence (6.85/10) scores may impact their ability to manage risk factors and adhere to treatment plans.

These factors combined contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potential medical interventions are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

2. **Uncontrolled diabetes**  
   - HbA1c 9.6% and fasting glucose >135 mg/dL.  
   - Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD; poor control accelerates decline.  

3. **Hypertension**  
   - Systolic BP 174 mmHg (diastolic normal but isolated systolic high).  
   - Hypertension contributes to glomerular injury and worsens proteinuria.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: At 87 years old, age is a significant risk factor. Additionally, a low socioeconomic status may limit access to healthcare resources and healthy lifestyle choices.
2. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk.
3. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (38.28) indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD. Moderate alcohol consumption (16 units/week) and relatively low physical activity (3.11 hours/week) also contribute to the risk.
4. **Clinical Measurements**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (132 mmHg), fasting glucose (101.64 mg/dL), and HbA1c (9.07%) suggest hypertension and impaired glucose regulation, which are risk factors for CKD. The GFR (98.15 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range but on the lower end for someone without other significant kidney function indicators. Protein in urine (0.46 g/day) and ACR (13.51 mg/g) are slightly elevated, indicating some level of kidney damage.
5. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but NSAID use (3.37 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function. Good medication adherence (9.71/10) is a positive factor, but low health literacy (0.17/10) may hinder understanding and management of CKD risk factors.
6. **Other Factors**: The absence of heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure and good water quality reduces environmental risk factors.

Considering these factors, the overall risk score reflects a heightened risk for CKD due to lifestyle, clinical, and some behavioral factors, despite the absence of a family history of kidney diseases. Managing modifiable risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and glucose levels, and monitoring kidney function closely are crucial to mitigating this risk.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 70/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which is beneficial, other factors outweigh this positive aspect.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is 132 mmHg, which is higher than the ideal range (< 120 mmHg), indicating stage 1 hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is 101.64 mg/dL, and the HbA1c is 9.07%, indicating poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD, even though there's no reported diagnosis of diabetes.
4. **Renal Function Tests**: The creatinine level is within the normal range, and the GFR is 98.15 mL/min/1.73 m², which indicates normal renal function at this time. However, the presence of protein in the urine (0.4555868718309863 g/day) and an elevated ACR (13.510649191955604 mg/g) suggest some degree of kidney damage or disease.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus levels are within normal ranges. However, the total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and, indirectly, to CKD progression.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for blood pressure control and renal protection, but the occasional use of NSAIDs could pose a risk to kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps may indicate underlying issues that could be related to CKD or other comorbid conditions, affecting overall quality of life.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Frequent medical checkups and high medication adherence are positive factors. However, low health literacy could hinder optimal management of health conditions.

The provided data indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to several key factors:
1. **High Blood Pressure**: With a systolic BP of 171 mmHg and diastolic BP of 107 mmHg, hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage kidneys over time.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine at 2.568 mg/dL and BUN at 44.253 mg/dL suggest impaired kidney function. Elevated levels of these waste products indicate the kidneys are not filtering efficiently.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 50.820 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range (which is typically considered to be above 90), indicating some level of kidney dysfunction.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.718 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys should not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease mentioned, the presence of other risk factors compensates for this in the risk assessment.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the individual has a high BMI (32.184), which can increase the risk of developing conditions that harm the kidneys (like diabetes and hypertension), the absence of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are positive factors. However, the diet quality and physical activity levels, though within provided ranges, could be optimized for better health outcomes.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, despite their potential benefits, can also have adverse effects on kidney function, especially with frequent NSAID use. Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score, may reflect underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and well-being.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups, moderate medication adherence, and low health literacy may hinder optimal management of kidney health and related conditions.

Overall, while some factors like the absence of family history of hypertension, diabetes, and previous AKI are positive, the cumulative effect of high blood pressure, signs of kidney dysfunction, and lifestyle factors contributes to a significant risk score for CKD.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, driven by several key factors:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures are significantly higher than the normal range, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Impaired Glycemic Control**: The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Reduced Kidney Function**: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine, as indicated by the protein-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: The elevated potassium and phosphate levels may indicate impaired kidney function and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs may exacerbate kidney damage, especially in the presence of pre-existing kidney disease.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI, low physical activity, and poor diet quality may contribute to the development and progression of CKD.

While some factors, such as the absence of family history of kidney disease and good water quality, are favorable, they are outweighed by the numerous high-risk factors present. The overall risk score reflects the need for close monitoring and management of these risk factors to prevent or slow CKD progression.",83,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 3.808835054612549 mg/dL and a GFR of 56.83322449059071 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 3.88028284003322 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
4. **Hypertension and Blood Glucose Levels**: Although systolic BP is within a relatively manageable range, the diastolic BP is elevated, and fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest poor glucose control, which can exacerbate kidney disease.
5. **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: History of UTIs can contribute to kidney damage over time.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While some lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and physical activity are within relatively healthy ranges, a BMI of 32.164662552860825 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage and slow the progression of the disease.",87,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The risk score is high due to several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history is a significant risk factor for CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated, indicating potential hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The high fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, potentially indicating diabetes or prediabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
4. **Renal Function Indicators**: The elevated creatinine level and decreased GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) indicate impaired kidney function.
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances and Metabolic Factors**: Abnormal levels of certain electrolytes and metabolic parameters, such as elevated phosphorus and triglycerides, can impact kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score, suggests significant impact from kidney disease.
8. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidney function, and the absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, further increase the risk.

- Elevated blood pressure (173/110 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for kidney damage.
- Impaired glucose regulation indicated by HbA1c of 9.51%, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, which can affect kidney function.
- Presence of protein in the urine (0.4387786291848095 g/day) and an elevated ACR (2.68157327041445 mg/g), indicating kidney damage or disease.
- Reduced kidney function as suggested by a GFR of 65.97 mL/min/1.73 m², which is below the normal range.
- The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which can be symptoms of chronic kidney disease.
- Low medication adherence and health literacy, which can negatively impact disease management.

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk.
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (173/110 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Diabetes**: Although there's no personal history of diabetes, the family history of diabetes and an HbA1c level of 9.51% suggest a potential risk or pre-diabetic state.
4. **Kidney Function**: A GFR of 65.97 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates mildly impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in urine (0.4387786291848095 g/day) and an ACR of 2.68157327041445 mg/g suggests kidney damage.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (6.24033308932908 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and poor medication adherence (2.5741525356446915/10) and low health literacy (0.4815011538280989/10) may further exacerbate the risk due to potential mismanagement of health conditions.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and symptoms. The rationale for this score is based on the following main points:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk of CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (173/110 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Glucose Control**: The HbA1c level of 9.51% indicates poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD, especially with a family history of diabetes.
4. **Kidney Function**: The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 65.97 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.4388 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 2.68 mg/g are indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The levels of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus) and hemoglobin are within normal ranges but need to be monitored due to the CKD risk.
7. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The high intake of alcohol (8.35 units/week) and use of NSAIDs (6.24 times/week) can be harmful to kidney health. The good diet quality and physical activity level are positive factors but may not fully compensate for the other risk factors.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low quality of life score, may indicate the presence of underlying health issues, including CKD.

These factors collectively contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease.

Very high baseline risk; CKD prevalence increases steeply after 65 y.
Blood pressure
173/110 mmHg
Severe hypertension accelerates glomerular damage and proteinuria.
Glycemic status
HbA1c 9.51%
Indicates uncontrolled diabetes, a major CKD driver even though no antidiabetic meds are prescribed.
Proteinuria
0.44 g/day
Reflects established glomerular injury; >0.3 g/day is a risk factor for progression.
GFR
66 mL/min/1.73 m²
Stage 3 CKD; moderate loss of filtration yet still at risk for decline.
NSAID use
6.2 times/week
Chronic NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion and contribute to acute‐on‑chronic injury.
Lipid profile
Total 269, LDL 160, HDL 34, Triglycerides 307
Dyslipidemia exacerbates vascular damage and promotes atherosclerosis in renal vessels.
Medication adherence
2.6/10
Low adherence increases the chance that blood‑pressure and lipid targets are not achieved.
Sleep quality & fatigue
Sleep 4.5/10, Fatigue 8.5/10
Chronic sleep deprivation and fatigue correlate with higher cardiovascular risk and may signal worsening renal function.
Lifestyle
BMI 15.8 (under‑weight), moderate alcohol, moderate physical activity
Low BMI may reflect malnutrition; moderate activity and alcohol are not protective.
Family history
Kidney disease present
Increases genetic susceptibility.
Given the combination of advanced age, uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, moderate proteinuria, frequent NSAID use, and poor medication adherence, the overall risk of CKD progression and complications is high.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered in this assessment include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk, as these conditions are risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 116 mmHg and diastolic of 65 mmHg is within a relatively normal range but on the higher end, which could be a concern with other comorbidities.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels are near the upper limit of normal, suggesting pre-diabetic conditions, which can increase CKD risk.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is within the normal range, and the estimated GFR (eGFR) of 83.93 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates good kidney function, but the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While mostly within normal ranges, the total cholesterol is on the higher end, which could contribute to cardiovascular risk, a comorbidity that affects CKD progression.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and statins may indicate management of hypertension and high cholesterol, respectively. The presence of muscle cramps could be related to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI indicating overweight status, moderate alcohol consumption, and a diet quality score of 6.25 out of 10 suggest areas for improvement to reduce CKD risk.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups and good medication adherence are positive factors, but health literacy could be improved.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the current kidney function is relatively preserved, and the management of comorbid conditions appears to be underway. Lifestyle modifications, continued monitoring, and adherence to medications are crucial to mitigate the risk of CKD progression.",34,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 42/100**

The risk score is based on various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here's a brief rationale with main points:

1. **Family History**: You have a family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD. However, you don't have a family history of kidney disease.
2. **BP and Glucose**: Your systolic blood pressure (116 mmHg) and fasting glucose (97.68 mg/dL) are within normal limits, which is favorable.
3. **Kidney Function**: Your creatinine (0.96 mg/dL) and GFR (83.93 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate relatively normal kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: You have a moderate level of protein in your urine (1.43 g/day), which is a risk factor for CKD. The ACR (146.75 mg/g) is also elevated.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Your electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits. Your total cholesterol (242.46 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, but your HDL cholesterol (56.24 mg/dL) is good.
6. **Medications**: You're taking diuretics, which can affect kidney function, and statins, which can help reduce cardiovascular risk.
7. **Lifestyle**: Your BMI (28.32) indicates overweight, which is a risk factor for CKD. You also have a moderate level of physical activity (3.71 hours/week) and a relatively good diet quality (6.25/10).
8. **Symptoms and QoL**: You don't have significant symptoms like edema or nausea, but you experience some fatigue and muscle cramps.

Considering these factors, your risk score is 23/100, indicating a moderate risk of developing CKD. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitoring your blood pressure and glucose, and managing your proteinuria are essential to reducing your risk.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is based on various factors, including family history, medical history, lifestyle, and current health indicators. The main points contributing to this score include:

- Family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for kidney disease.
- Elevated BMI (28.321910867418687), indicating overweight status, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease.
- Suboptimal diet quality (6.248231420934378/10) and moderate physical activity (3.71192236145994 hours/week), which could contribute to higher risks if not improved.
- Slightly elevated fasting glucose (97.68078076884542 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.013773954844694%), indicating pre-diabetic conditions, which are risk factors for kidney disease.
- Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can affect kidney function.
- The presence of some symptoms like fatigue and muscle cramps, which could be indicative of early kidney issues, though not conclusively diagnostic.

However, the following factors mitigate the risk:
- Good sleep quality (9.670705173324016/10), which is beneficial for overall health.
- No history of AKI or UTIs, which are direct kidney insults.
- Good control of blood pressure (116/65 mmHg) and relatively good kidney function (GFR: 83.93361813947314 mL/min/1.73 m²).
- The absence of heavy metals and occupational chemical exposure, which can harm kidneys.

**Rationale**  
- **Proteinuria & ACR** – A 1.4 g/day protein excretion and an albumin‑creatinine ratio of 147 mg/g are above the 30 mg/g threshold for CKD; this alone places the individual in a moderate‑to‑high risk bracket.  
- **eGFR** – At 84 mL/min/1.73 m² the kidney filtration rate is still within the normal range, so the risk is not yet “stage 3” but the proteinuria flags early disease.  
- **Age & BMI** – Young age lowers risk, but a BMI of 28 is overweight, contributing modestly to kidney stress.  
- **Blood pressure & family history** – Normal BP now but a family history of hypertension raises future risk; no current antihypertensive therapy.

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided information. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are significant risk factors for CKD, increases the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 161 mmHg is elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD as it can damage kidney vessels over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: A level of 199.11 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose regulation, which is close to the threshold for diabetes diagnosis. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: Although the GFR (106.77 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (0.3198 g/day) and an elevated ACR (225.94 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and a high alcohol intake (18.01 units/week) are detrimental to kidney health. While the BMI is within a healthy range, and physical activity and diet quality are relatively good, these positive lifestyle factors are somewhat offset by smoking and alcohol consumption.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for hypertension and can also protect the kidneys, is beneficial. However, the frequent use of NSAIDs (3.35 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score, may indicate underlying issues that could be related to kidney function or other health concerns.

These factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk score for CKD, highlighting the need for continued monitoring of kidney function, management of hypertension and glucose levels, and adjustment of lifestyle factors to mitigate risk.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score:** 68/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are both risk factors for CKD.
2. **Clinical Measurements**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (161 mmHg), high fasting glucose (199.11 mg/dL), and HbA1c (5.56%) indicate potential issues with blood pressure and glucose control, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
3. **Kidney Function**: Although the GFR (106.77 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (0.32 g/day) and an elevated ACR (225.94 mg/g) suggest some degree of kidney damage or disease.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption are both risk factors for CKD.
5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs and occupational chemical exposure may also contribute to kidney risk.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Less frequent medical checkups and lower medication adherence may hinder the management of risk factors and detection of CKD at an early stage.

Despite some positive factors such as a healthy BMI, good diet quality, and regular physical activity, the combination of these risk factors and clinical indicators suggests a significant risk for developing or progressing CKD. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with lifestyle modifications and adherence to medical recommendations, are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 65/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health metrics. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* Family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
* Elevated systolic blood pressure (161 mmHg) and fasting glucose (199.11 mg/dL), indicating potential hypertension and diabetes, both of which can damage kidney function.
* High levels of protein in urine (8 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 225.94 mg/g, suggesting kidney damage.
* Use of ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial for CKD management but also indicates the presence of a condition requiring such medication.
* History of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, which can negatively impact kidney health.
* Relatively low diet quality (/10) and moderate physical activity (6 hours/week), which may not be sufficient to mitigate CKD risk factors.
* Presence of symptoms such as fatigue (5./10), nausea/vomiting (1.4884 times/week), muscle cramps ( times/week), and itching (6.6251/10), which could be indicative of underlying kidney issues.
* Occupational chemical exposure, which may pose additional risks to kidney health.

However, factors such as good water quality, absence of heavy metals exposure, and relatively high GFR (106.77 mL/min/1.73 m²) contribute to a slightly lower risk score.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors including demographic information, medical history, laboratory results, lifestyle, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (164/107 mmHg) are elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level (2.2546740278058603 mg/dL) and BUN level (30.348476423363692 mg/dL) are higher than normal, indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.847387639922184 g/day) with an ACR of 6.0994328920292435 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Low GFR**: Although the GFR (93.11166105431232 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, it is on the lower end, indicating reduced kidney function.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI (29.96410875395775) and low physical activity (5.1784138860686575 hours/week) contribute to an increased risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of NSAIDs (5.9516991133179244 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use.
8. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of CKD, although these symptoms are non-specific and can be caused by many conditions.

Despite a good diet quality, high education level, and good water quality, the cumulative effect of the aforementioned risk factors contributes to an elevated risk score for CKD.

Brief Rationale
Key Factor
Current Value
Impact on CKD Risk
Age
75 yrs
Age itself is a major risk driver; CKD prevalence rises sharply after 70.
Hypertension
164/107 mmHg
Uncontrolled BP is the most potent cause of glomerular injury and rapid GFR decline.
Proteinuria
1.85 g/day
Heavy protein loss strongly predicts progressive CKD irrespective of baseline GFR.
Serum Creatinine
2.25 mg/dL
Indicates a reduced filtration rate; combined with high proteinuria signals early kidney stress.
NSAID use
~6 × week
Chronic NSAID exposure can precipitate or worsen kidney injury, especially in the setting of hypertension.
Race (Black)
•
Black individuals have a higher baseline risk of CKD progression, often needing earlier intervention even when eGFR is preserved.
Family history of HTN
Positive
Genetic predisposition to vascular and renal damage.
Other labs
Normal electrolytes, normal hemoglobin, lipid profile within acceptable limits
These do not counterbalance the major risk drivers above.
Why 78/100?The combination of advanced age, poorly controlled hypertension, significant proteinuria, chronic NSAID use, and Black race places the individual in a high‑risk category for CKD progression. Even with a relatively preserved eGFR, the risk of rapid decline is substantial. Reducing BP, limiting NSAIDs, initiating ACE/ARB therapy, and regular monitoring of proteinuria and creatinine would be critical next steps.",78.0,Asian,Black

The provided risk score for chronic kidney disease is based on the analysis of various factors, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease, as hypertension is a significant risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The current systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (164/107 mmHg) are elevated, which is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Kidney Function**: Although the GFR (93.11 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (1.847387639922184 g/day) and an elevated ACR (6.0994328920292435 mg/g) indicate some degree of kidney damage or disease.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: The relatively low physical activity level (5.1784138860686575 hours/week) and high BMI (29.96410875395775) can contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, as they are associated with a higher risk of developing hypertension and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for kidney disease.
5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (5.9516991133179244 times/week) can potentially harm kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use. Occupational chemical exposure may also pose a risk to kidney health.
6. **Health Behaviors**: The low frequency of medical checkups (1.1015470756733587 per year) and limited health literacy (1.2835544478238536/10) might hinder the early detection and management of kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* Family history of hypertension, which increases the risk of developing CKD
* Elevated fasting glucose (167.375 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.162%) levels, indicating poor blood sugar control and potential diabetic nephropathy
* High blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (46.166 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.435 mg/dL) level, suggesting impaired kidney function
* Presence of protein in urine (1.460 g/day) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 0.477 mg/g, indicating kidney damage
* Poor diet quality (4.704/10) and low physical activity (3.716 hours/week), which can contribute to CKD progression
* Use of NSAIDs (9.563 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and worsen kidney function
* Poor water quality, which may expose you to toxins and heavy metals that can harm kidney function
* Low medication adherence (0.562/10) and moderate health literacy (6.889/10), which can lead to inadequate management of CKD risk factors

However, some factors decrease the risk score, such as:

* Normal blood pressure (91/69 mmHg)
* High HDL cholesterol (66.793 mg/dL)
* Absence of edema, UTIs, and previous AKI

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Laboratory Results**:
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated levels (0251907731 mg/dL and 074%, respectively) indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
   - **Creatinine and GFR**: While the GFR (77 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the creatinine level (935 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, which may indicate some degree of kidney impairment.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (1952 g/day) with an ACR of 0. mg/g suggests kidney damage.
3. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (9.988996 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and increase the risk of CKD.
   - **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality may contain harmful substances that could affect kidney health.
4. **Health Behaviors**:
   - **Medication Adherence**: Low adherence to medication (0./10) could exacerbate underlying conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes, thereby increasing the risk of CKD.
   - **Health Literacy and Medical Checkups**: While health literacy is moderate (336/10), the frequency of medical checkups (3.821390/year) is good, which can help in early detection and management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors:

- **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (167.3750251907731 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.162499669488074%) indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for developing kidney disease, particularly diabetic nephropathy.
- **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.4604767474931952 g/day) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 0.4772479547321073 mg/g suggest kidney damage, as proteinuria is a marker of kidney disease.
- **Creatinine and GFR**: While the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is within the normal range (96.76886805020077 mL/min/1.73 m²), the slightly elevated creatinine level (1.435117435258935 mg/dL) may indicate some degree of kidney function impairment.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: Poor adherence to medication (0.5628367632020082/10), relatively low health literacy (6.889194959806336/10), and poor water quality could contribute to increased risk due to potential exposure to contaminants and suboptimal management of health conditions.
- **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: Although diet quality is relatively good (4.704076194668096/10), physical activity is somewhat limited (3.7162301035776766 hours/week), which could impact overall health and increase the risk of progressing to CKD if not balanced with a healthy lifestyle.

However, the absence of previous AKI, UTIs, and the lack of family history of kidney disease or diabetes somewhat mitigate the risk. Nonetheless, the presence of several significant risk factors warrants close monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of CKD progression.",74,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 72/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health conditions. The key points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **High BMI**: A BMI of 36.07592367319258 indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for CKD due to its association with diabetes, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases.
3. **Alcohol Consumption**: Consuming 16.52797547489267 units of alcohol per week is above moderate drinking levels and can increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Physical Activity**: Engaging in only 3.1066850591194664 hours of physical activity per week is below recommended levels, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle that increases CKD risk.
5. **Diet Quality and Sleep Quality**: A diet quality score of 6.406215490576886/10 and a sleep quality score of 4.6774620331532555/10 indicate room for improvement in these areas, as poor diet and sleep can exacerbate CKD risk.
6. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (148.84511219131713 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.46079109670689%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
7. **Kidney Function**: A GFR of 66.50704740002186 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range (>90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating some level of kidney function impairment. The presence of protein in the urine (3.2928960518045347 g/day) and an elevated ACR (276.8544207444622 mg/g) further support kidney damage.
8. **Electrolyte and Hemoglobin Levels**: While mostly within normal ranges, the combination of these factors with other risk elements contributes to the overall risk score.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, current health status, and exposures. The key points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes:** The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c:** Although the HbA1c level is not drastically high, the fasting glucose level is elevated, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to kidney damage over time.
3. **Reduced GFR:** A GFR of 66.50704740002186 mL/min/1.73 m² is lower than the ideal range (above 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating some level of kidney function impairment.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria):** The presence of protein in the urine, especially at a level of 3.2928960518045347 g/day, is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it suggests kidney damage.
5. **Higher BMI:** A BMI of 36.07592367319258 falls into the obese category, which is a risk factor for developing CKD due to the increased pressure and metabolic demand on the kidneys.
6. **Low Physical Activity and Poor Diet Quality:** Although the diet quality score is relatively moderate, low physical activity can contribute to a range of health issues, including obesity and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Use of NSAIDs:** Frequent use of NSAIDs can be harmful to kidney function, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney issues.
8. **Edema and Other Symptoms:** The presence of edema, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting could be indicative of underlying kidney issues, although these symptoms are non-specific and can be associated with a wide range of conditions.

Despite the absence of family kidney disease, previous AKI, UTIs, and certain other risk factors, the combination of factors mentioned above contributes to an elevated risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring of kidney function, management of glucose levels, lifestyle modifications (including weight loss, increased physical activity, and improved diet quality), and careful management of medications (such as NSAIDs) are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 75/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

* **Family history of hypertension**: This increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
* **High blood pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 104 mmHg are both above the normal range, which can damage kidneys over time.
* **Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c**: These indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of CKD.
* **High BMI**: A BMI of 39.5 is considered obese, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* **Protein in urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.21 g/day) and an elevated ACR (171.5 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
* **Electrolyte imbalance**: The high potassium level (5.2 mEq/L) may indicate impaired kidney function.
* **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and statins may be indicative of underlying conditions that increase the risk of CKD.
* **Lifestyle factors**: Limited physical activity (0.81 hours/week) and poor sleep quality (6.8/10) may also contribute to the risk of CKD.

However, some factors mitigate this risk, such as:
* **Good diet quality** (8.9/10) and **high health literacy** (9.9/10), which may help manage underlying conditions.
* **No family history of kidney disease or diabetes**, which reduces the genetic risk.
* **Good water quality** and **no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals**, which reduces environmental risk.

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as high blood pressure is a significant risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's current systolic and diastolic blood pressure (150/104 mmHg) is elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The patient's fasting glucose (140.52 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.74%) levels indicate prediabetes or insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of developing CKD.
4. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN**: The patient's creatinine (1.30 mg/dL) and BUN (36.49 mg/dL) levels are slightly elevated, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in urine (0.21 g/day) and an elevated ACR (171.48 mg/g) suggest kidney damage or disease.
6. **Obesity and Physical Inactivity**: The patient's high BMI (39.47) and low physical activity (0.81 hours/week) increase the risk of developing CKD.

The risk score is based on the provided information and takes into account several key factors that contribute to the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor, as it can indicate a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure, a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 104 mmHg indicate hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The elevated fasting glucose (140.5 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.74%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of kidney damage over time.
4. **Kidney Function (GFR and Creatinine)**: A GFR of 92.94 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, but the creatinine level is slightly elevated (1.30 mg/dL), indicating some degree of kidney function impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The ACR of 171.48 mg/g is elevated, indicating proteinuria, a key marker of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The presence of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) and an unfavorable lipid profile (high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol) can further increase the risk of CKD progression.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the frequent use of NSAIDs (9.1 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function. The high BMI (39.47) and relatively low physical activity level also contribute to the risk.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and a relatively low QoL score indicate possible kidney disease-related symptoms and decreased well-being.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Here are the main points that contributed to this risk score:

1. **Age and Demographics**: At 72 years old, age is a significant risk factor for CKD. However, being Caucasian and having a high socioeconomic status may have a somewhat protective effect due to better access to healthcare.

2. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 20.85 is within the normal range, which is positive. No smoking is also a protective factor. Alcohol consumption of 11.35 units/week is relatively moderate and not excessively high. Physical activity of 4.09 hours/week is somewhat low but still contributes to overall health. Diet quality is relatively low (2.72/10), which could be a risk factor, but sleep quality is average (5.21/10).

3. **Medical History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk. No previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) or UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) is also positive.

4. **Clinical Parameters**: Blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (121/87 mmHg), which is good. Fasting glucose is slightly elevated (105.45 mg/dL), indicating prediabetes, which is a risk factor for CKD. HbA1c is also slightly elevated (5.49%), supporting the presence of prediabetes. Creatinine is within the normal range (1.05 mg/dL), and GFR is actually higher than average (107.38 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating good kidney function at this time. BUN level is slightly elevated (28.47 mg/dL) but not significantly high. Protein in urine is present (0.764 g/day) with an ACR of 205.34 mg/g, indicating some level of kidney stress or damage.

5. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Electrolytes and lipid profiles are largely within normal ranges, although triglycerides are somewhat elevated (287.77 mg/dL), which could be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and indirectly for CKD.

6. **Medications**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications suggests management of cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which can help",34,African American,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 32/100

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided health information. Main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Age and Sex**: As a 72-year-old male, age is a significant risk factor, but being male does not particularly increase the risk in this context.
2. **Family History**: The absence of family histories of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
3. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: A BMI of 20.85 is within the normal range, which is positive. The alcohol consumption is moderate, physical activity is relatively low, and diet quality is poor, which could impact kidney health. Good sleep quality and not smoking are protective factors.
4. **Medical History and Current Health**: The absence of previous AKI and UTIs reduces the risk. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within relatively normal ranges. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are slightly elevated, indicating prediabetes, which is a risk factor for CKD. Creatinine and BUN levels are within normal limits, and GFR is above 90, indicating good kidney function. Protein in urine and ACR are slightly elevated, suggesting some degree of kidney stress.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Electrolyte and lipid profiles are mostly within normal ranges, though triglycerides are on the higher side.
6. **Medications**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, and the absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors could influence kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate some level of renal dysfunction or other health issues. The quality of life score is moderate.
8. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Good water quality, no heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure, regular medical checkups, good medication adherence, and high health literacy are all protective factors.

Given these factors, the risk score of 34/100 suggests a moderate risk of developing CKD, primarily driven by age, slightly elevated glucose levels, moderate lifestyle factors, and the presence of some symptoms. Regular monitoring of kidney function, management of glucose levels, and adjustments to lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity could help mitigate this risk.",34,African American,Asian,**Risk Score: 38/100**,38.0,African American,Asian

1. **Age and Demographics**: At 72 years old, age is a significant risk factor for CKD. Being male and of Black ethnicity also increases the risk.
2. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
3. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 20.85 is within the normal range, which is beneficial. No smoking is also a positive factor. However, alcohol consumption of 11.35 units/week is relatively high and may contribute to increased risk. Physical activity of 4.09 hours/week is moderate, and diet quality is relatively low (2.72/10), which could negatively impact kidney health.
4. **Clinical Data**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within relatively normal ranges (121/87 mmHg), but the fasting glucose level (105.45 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.49%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.

The risk score is based on the provided data, taking into account various factors that contribute to the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered are:
- **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: High socioeconomic status, higher education, a relatively healthy BMI, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and regular physical activity contribute to a lower risk. However, diet quality is low, which could increase the risk.
- **Medical History and Current Health**: The absence of previous AKI and UTIs is positive. However, the presence of statin and antidiabetic medication use suggests management of conditions that could impact kidney health.
- **Clinical Measures**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are within a relatively normal range. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are slightly elevated, indicating potential pre-diabetic conditions. The GFR is within the normal range, which is a positive indicator of kidney function. Protein in urine and ACR levels are mildly elevated, suggesting some kidney stress.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, may indicate some kidney dysfunction or related issues.
- **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Good water quality, no heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure, regular medical checkups, high medication adherence, and good health literacy all contribute to a lower risk.

Rationale
Age – At 72, the baseline risk for CKD rises significantly.
Albuminuria (ACR ≈ 205 mg/g) – Exceeds the 200 mg/g threshold for micro‑albuminuria, indicating early kidney damage despite a normal eGFR.
NSAID use – 5–6 times per week elevates the likelihood of drug‑induced nephrotoxicity.
GFR & Creatinine – A normal eGFR (~107 mL/min/1.73 m²) and creatinine near upper normal limit suggest current kidney function is preserved, but the presence of albuminuria signals impending decline.
Metabolic profile – Mildly elevated fasting glucose (≈ 105 mg/dL) and triglycerides (~288 mg/dL) contribute to vascular risk; however, HbA1c is within normal limits, reducing diabetes‑related risk.
Lifestyle factors – Low diet quality (0.27/10) and moderate sleep (5.2/10) may indirectly affect renal health.
Overall assessment – The combination of age, early albuminuria, and NSAID exposure places this individual at moderate risk for progression to CKD, warranting closer monitoring and lifestyle modification.",32.0,African American,Hispanic

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 34/100

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 34 out of 100. This score is based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health status. The main points contributing to this score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as it increases the likelihood of developing high blood pressure, a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **High Creatinine Level**: The creatinine level of 3.4352264947731084 mg/dL is slightly elevated, indicating some degree of kidney impairment. However, the concomitant GFR of 106.41466330532576 mL/min/1.73 m² suggests that despite the elevated creatinine, the kidneys are still filtering waste effectively, which somewhat mitigates this risk.
3. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The ACR of 176.71960148925038 mg/g is elevated, suggesting some level of kidney damage or disease, as protein leakage into the urine is a common indicator of kidney issues.
4. **Blood Pressure**: The diastolic blood pressure of 112 mmHg is elevated, which is a risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney function over time.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While some values are within normal ranges, the high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, alongside the relatively high sodium level, could contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to CKD risk.
6. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (3.225364432329818 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and increases the risk of developing CKD.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate level of fatigue, could be indicative of underlying kidney issues, though these symptoms are non-specific and can be related to a wide range of conditions.

However, factors that reduce the risk score include:
- **Young Age**: At 23, the risk of CKD is generally lower compared to older adults.
- **High Diet Quality and Good Sleep Quality**: These factors contribute to overall health and may help mitigate some risks associated with CKD.
- **No Smoking and Moderate Alcohol Use**: These lifestyle choices",34,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 35/100
Rationale
Factor
Value
Impact on CKD risk
Age
23 y
Very low baseline risk (CKD is rare in young adults)
Blood pressure
107/112 mmHg
Diastolic hypertension (>110 mmHg) is a strong CKD driver; contributes to early kidney damage
Proteinuria / ACR
0.141 g/day (141 mg) / 176 mg/g
Moderate albuminuria (ACR >150 mg/g) signals glomerular injury; major independent predictor of CKD progression
Serum creatinine

Elevated value suggests impaired filtration; inconsistent with reported GFR but indicates a potential lab anomaly or acute change
GFR
106 mL/min/1.73 m²
Normal value, but if creatinine is truly high, it could reflect an early decline that hasn’t yet lowered GFR
NSAID use
~3.2 times/week
Repeated NSAID exposure can precipitate or worsen renal injury, especially with proteinuria
Other metabolic markers
Normal glucose, HbA1c, lipids
No diabetes or dyslipidemia to accelerate CKD
Lifestyle
Good diet quality, moderate alcohol, low physical activity
Generally protective but low activity may marginally increase risk
Summary:The patient’s young age and otherwise normal metabolic profile would suggest a low CKD risk. However, the combination of moderate albuminuria (ACR 176 mg/g), elevated diastolic blood pressure, high creatinine, and frequent NSAID use raises concern for early kidney injury. Given these red‑flag indicators, the calculated risk is moderate (≈35 / 100). Early intervention—tight BP control, avoidance of NSAIDs, and routine monitoring of renal function—would be recommended to mitigate progression.",35.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The provided risk score is based on the evaluation of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here's a brief rationale with main points:

- **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, but there's no family history of kidney disease or diabetes, which are stronger risk factors.
- **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, but the diastolic blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could indicate some level of risk.
- **Laboratory Results**: The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, suggesting good glycemic control. However, the creatinine level is somewhat elevated, which could indicate reduced kidney function. The GFR is above 90 mL/min/1.73 m², suggesting preserved kidney function, but the ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio) is significantly elevated, indicating potential kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The high diet quality, moderate alcohol consumption, and absence of smoking are positive factors. However, the physical activity level is relatively low.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying health issues, including potential kidney problems. The quality of life score is somewhat reduced.
- **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, even if not frequent, could pose a risk to kidney function over time. There's no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, which is positive.

Overall, while there are some indicators of potential kidney risk, such as elevated creatinine and ACR, the presence of a high GFR and the absence of diabetes or kidney disease in the family history suggest a moderate risk level. The risk score of 34/100 reflects these factors, indicating a need for continued monitoring and possibly lifestyle adjustments to mitigate risk factors.",34,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 32/100

The provided risk score is based on the detailed information given about the individual's health and lifestyle. Here are the main points that contribute to this assessment:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 23 years old and having a high socioeconomic status generally associates with better health outcomes, including lower risk for chronic diseases due to likely better access to healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices.

2. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD. However, the absence of family histories of kidney disease and diabetes somewhat mitigates this risk.

3. **Lifestyle Factors**: The individual's BMI is within the normal range, which is positive. However, the alcohol consumption, while within the provided range, and physical activity level could be optimized for better health outcomes. The diet quality is high, which is beneficial.

4. **Medical History and Current Health Status**: The absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI) and UTIs reduces the risk. The blood pressure readings are somewhat concerning, especially the diastolic pressure being higher than the systolic, which is unusual and may indicate an issue, but overall, they do not strongly indicate hypertension at this stage. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, which is positive for avoiding diabetic nephropathy, a common cause of CKD.

5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR is within the normal range, indicating good kidney function. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the BUN level is near the upper limit of the normal range, which could suggest some degree of kidney stress or impairment but is not definitively indicative of CKD without further context or progression.

6. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, and while the total cholesterol and LDL levels are somewhat elevated, they do not drastically increase the CKD risk on their own without other contributing factors like diabetes or significant hypertension.

7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and some level of itching could be related to numerous conditions, including potential early signs of kidney issues, but are non-specific.

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided information:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a risk factor for CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures (126/116 mmHg) are elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (118.63363584587066 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.605249352571567%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 132.02301939443183 mg/g is elevated, indicating kidney damage, as healthy kidneys filter waste while retaining necessary proteins.
5. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and a moderate level of alcohol consumption (12.68380153842382 units/week) can exacerbate kidney damage and contribute to the risk of CKD.
6. **Physical Activity and Diet Quality**: The relatively low level of physical activity (3.257370224504327 hours/week) and moderate diet quality (5.3208057068289705/10) may contribute to the overall risk profile.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications suggests management of cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors but also indicates the presence of conditions that contribute to CKD risk. The frequency of medical checkups and medication adherence are fair, but health literacy is moderate, which could impact disease management and prevention strategies.

These factors are balanced against the relatively preserved kidney function (GFR of 93.47101588657068 mL/min/1.73 m²), which is within the normal range, and the absence of certain other risk factors like family kidney disease and heavy metals exposure.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, and current health status. The key factors contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as it can increase the likelihood of developing conditions that affect kidney function.
2. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although there is no family history of hypertension, the current blood pressure (126/116 mmHg) is elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated glucose levels (118.63363584587066 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.605249352571567%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney damage.
4. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The creatinine level (0.6155611873656565 mg/dL) and GFR (93.47101588657068 mL/min/1.73 m²) are within normal ranges but at the lower and upper limits, respectively. However, the presence of protein in the urine (4.102247284613441 g/day) and a high ACR (132.02301939443183 mg/g) are indicative of kidney stress or damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. While the physical activity level is relatively low, and diet quality is average, these factors can contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications may indicate management of conditions that can affect kidney health, but also suggests the presence of these conditions.
7. **Occupational Chemical Exposure**: Exposure to certain chemicals can increase the risk of kidney damage.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease. It is crucial to continue monitoring blood pressure, glucose levels, and kidney function, and to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, increased physical activity, improved diet quality, and reduced alcohol consumption, can help mitigate this risk.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease is 73 out of 100, indicating a relatively high risk. The rationale for this score is based on several key factors:

- **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes contributes to an increased risk, as diabetes is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- **Hypertension**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are elevated (126/116 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (118.63363584587066 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.605249352571567%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing CKD.
- **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The proteinuria level is high (4.102247284613441 g/day, with an ACR of 132.02301939443183 mg/g), indicating kidney damage, a direct marker of CKD.
- **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: Although within ranges, the sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and lipid profiles (especially the high total cholesterol and triglycerides) can contribute to vascular and kidney health issues if not managed properly.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption may further exacerbate kidney risk, though the protective effect of moderate physical activity and relatively good diet quality somewhat mitigate this.
- **Medications and Adherence**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications is beneficial for managing risk factors but the absence of ACE inhibitors, which are protective for kidneys, and the use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidney function, also play a role in the risk assessment.
- **Health Behaviors and Quality of Life**: Regular medical checkups, good medication adherence, and fair health literacy contribute positively, but symptoms like nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, and a moderate quality of life score, indicate some level of distress and possible undermanagement of CKD risk factors.

Overall, while there are some positive factors, the presence of hypertension, diabetes risk, proteinuria, and lifestyle challenges contribute to a significant risk of chronic kidney disease.",73,Asian,Black,"**Risk Score: 65/100**

**Rationale**

- **Proteinuria & ACR:** 4.1 g/day and 132 mg/g strongly suggest early kidney damage; these are among the most powerful predictors of CKD progression.  
- **Diabetes Indicators:** HbA1c of 7.6 % and fasting glucose >118 mg/dL place the patient in a pre‑diabetic/diabetic range, increasing CKD risk.  
- **Hypertension:** Diastolic pressure of 116 mmHg (systolic 126) indicates uncontrolled blood pressure, a major risk factor for CKD, especially with the absence of ACE inhibitor use.

2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure (126 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (116 mmHg) are elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (118.63363584587066 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.605249352571567%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, suggesting prediabetes or diabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 4.102247284613441 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
5. **Reduced Renal Function Indicators**: Although the GFR (93.47101588657068 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the combination of proteinuria and other risk factors suggests that kidney function may be impaired or at risk of worsening.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption (12.68380153842382 units/week) can further increase the risk of CKD by damaging blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the kidneys.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications indicates management of risk factors like high cholesterol and diabetes but also suggests the presence of these conditions, which increase CKD risk.

Given these factors, the risk score of 73/100 reflects a heightened risk for CKD due to a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors, and existing health conditions. Early intervention and management of these risk factors can help mitigate the progression of kidney disease.",73,Asian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 74/100
Rationale – Main Points
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD Risk
Age
38 y
Younger age reduces risk, but not enough to offset other factors.
Blood pressure
126/116 mmHg
Diastolic hypertension (≥ 110 mmHg) is a strong independent predictor of progressive kidney damage.
Proteinuria
4.1 g/day (high)
Persistent albumin‑proteinuria > 3 g/day signals significant glomerular injury; drives progression.
ACR
132 mg/g
Above 30 mg/g threshold; confirms albuminuria and raises risk.
Diabetes markers
Fasting glucose 119 mg/dL, HbA1c 7.6%
Mild‑to‑moderate hyperglycaemia increases renal microvascular damage.
NSAID use
~0.7 times/week
Recurrent NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion and exacerbate proteinuria.
Lifestyle
Smoking + moderate alcohol (≈13 U/wk)
Both raise systemic inflammation and vascular risk, compounding kidney stress.
Socioeconomic & educational status
Low SES, high‑school education
Often correlates with reduced access to preventative care and poorer disease management.
Lipid profile
Total 280 mg/dL, LDL 147 mg/dL, HDL 28 mg/dL, Triglycerides 316 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerotic renal vessel disease.
Baseline kidney function
GFR 93 mL/min/1.73 m², Creatinine 0.62 mg/dL
Currently preserved, but early proteinuria indicates potential early decline.
Family history
Diabetes present; no kidney disease
Genetic predisposition to diabetic nephropathy.
Overall assessment:Although the GFR is still within normal limits, the combination of high proteinuria, elevated diastolic pressure, diabetes markers, NSAID exposure, smoking, and dyslipidemia places this patient at a moderate‑high risk for progression to chronic kidney disease. The calculated score of 74/100 reflects that while immediate renal function is preserved, the modifiable risk factors and biochemical evidence of ongoing injury warrant close monitoring and aggressive risk‑reduction interventions.",74.0,Asian,Hispanic

The provided data suggests a moderate to high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Kidney function indicators**: The elevated Creatinine level (1.49 mg/dL) and relatively high BUN level (47.18 mg/dL) may indicate impaired kidney function. However, the GFR (116.58 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, which somewhat mitigates these concerns.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.09 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 34.96 mg/g suggests kidney damage, a key indicator of CKD.

3. **Electrolyte imbalance**: Although most electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the slightly elevated Phosphorus level (3.18 mg/dL) could be a concern in the context of kidney health.

4. **Medications and lifestyle**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (6.58 times/week) can be nephrotoxic and may contribute to kidney damage over time. Smoking and modest alcohol consumption are also risk factors for CKD.

5. **Symptoms and quality of life**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue (7.84/10), frequent muscle cramps (5.18 times/week), and severe itching (8.46/10) could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and quality of life.

6. **Health behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups (0.36 times/year) and moderate medication adherence (3.40/10) may hinder the early detection and management of kidney disease.

7. **Exposures**: Occupational chemical exposure could potentially harm kidney function, although the impact may vary depending on the specific chemicals involved and the level of exposure.

Despite these risk factors, the absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, along with good water quality and high health literacy (9.98/10), somewhat lowers the risk. Overall, the combination of kidney function indicators, lifestyle factors, and symptoms leads to a moderate to high risk score for chronic kidney disease.

The provided patient data indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: Although the patient does not have a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which are common risk factors for CKD, the absence of these does not significantly lower the risk given the presence of other factors.
   
2. **Lifestyle and Medical History**: The patient smokes and consumes alcohol, both of which can negatively impact kidney function. There's also a history of diuretic use and NSAIDs consumption, which can be harmful to the kidneys, especially with frequent use.

3. **Clinical Parameters**: The patient's blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, but the presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can indicate kidney issues. The GFR is slightly elevated, which might not be immediately concerning but combined with other symptoms and factors, warrants monitoring.

4. **Laboratory Results**: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are within normal limits, but the protein in urine (though low) and ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) suggest some level of kidney stress or damage. Electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges.

5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, as mentioned, can increase the risk of kidney problems. Occupational chemical exposure is also a risk factor for kidney disease.

6. **Health Behaviors**: The patient's adherence to medication and health literacy are positives, but the low frequency of medical check-ups could delay the detection and management of kidney issues.

Considering these factors, the patient is at a significant risk for developing chronic kidney disease, necessitating closer monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and improving diet quality), and possibly a review of current medications to mitigate potential kidney damage. Regular medical check-ups and strict adherence to prescribed treatments are crucial to prevent the progression of CKD.",73,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 55/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively high due to several factors:
- Elevated creatinine levels (2.89 mg/dL) and a relatively high BUN level (40.71 mg/dL) suggest impaired kidney function.
- Although the GFR is within the normal range (106.79 mL/min/1.73 m²), the presence of protein in the urine (0.31 g/day) and an elevated ACR (42.05 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
- The patient's lifestyle factors, such as smoking and a diet quality score of 3.48/10, may also contribute to the increased risk of chronic kidney disease.
- Additionally, the patient's high systolic blood pressure (145 mmHg), high total cholesterol (205.36 mg/dL), and high triglycerides (379.59 mg/dL) may further increase the risk of kidney disease.
- The patient's relatively low hemoglobin level (11.41 g/dL) and low BMI (17.37) may also be contributing factors.
- However, the patient's high socioeconomic status, regular medical checkups (3.17 times/year), and moderate health literacy (6.28/10) may help mitigate some of these risks.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 47/100

Impact on CKD Risk
Blood pressure
Systolic 145 mmHg (borderline‑high)
Hypertension is the most common modifiable driver of CKD progression.
Proteinuria / ACR
0.307 g/day, ACR 42 mg/g
Mild microalbuminuria signals early glomerular injury and elevates long‑term CKD risk.
Serum creatinine & eGFR
Creatinine 2.89 mg/dL (high), eGFR 107 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal)
The discrepancy suggests possible muscle wasting or assay variability; nonetheless, elevated creatinine flags reduced filtration capacity.
Lifestyle
• Smoking present<br>• NSAID use ~4 ×/week
Both increase renal vascular resistance and can accelerate tubular damage.
Metabolic profile
LDL 164 mg/dL, triglycerides 380 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerotic renal artery disease, compounding risk.
Other factors
Low BMI (underweight), high fatigue, low medication adherence, poor dietary quality
These may reflect suboptimal overall health status, which can exacerbate renal decline.
Overall, the presence of hypertension, microalbuminuria, elevated creatinine, frequent NSAID use, and smoking collectively raise the estimated 10‑year CKD progression risk to moderate‑high.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **High Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 2.88 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 145 mmHg is above the normal range, and while diastolic BP is within the normal range, the overall blood pressure is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 0.307 g/day of protein in urine, combined with an ACR of 42.054 mg/g, suggests kidney damage, a key indicator of CKD.
4. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the absence of previous AKI and UTIs does not significantly mitigate the current risk factors.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and a diet quality score of 3.477/10 may contribute to the risk of CKD progression.
6. **Abnormal Lab Values**: Elevated BUN levels and slightly low hemoglobin levels may also contribute to the overall risk assessment.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs and suboptimal medication adherence may further increase the risk.

However, factors such as good water quality, no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, and regular medical checkups somewhat mitigate the risk. Despite these, the cumulative effect of the elevated creatinine, blood pressure, proteinuria, and lifestyle factors significantly increases the risk score for CKD.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 28/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated based on the provided clinical and demographic data. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

* Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, indicating poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
* Family history of kidney disease is denied, but the presence of previous UTIs may contribute to CKD risk.
* Current kidney function, as indicated by creatinine and GFR, is within relatively normal ranges but close to the threshold of impaired function.
* Proteinuria (protein in urine) is present, with an ACR of 220.169329544143 mg/g, which is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
* The patient has a history of smoking, which is a known risk factor for CKD, and consumes alcohol, though at moderate levels.
* The patient's BMI indicates obesity, which is also a risk factor for CKD.
* Medication use, including diuretics, and occasional use of NSAIDs, may impact kidney function.
* The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score, may be indicative of underlying kidney issues or other comorbid conditions affecting kidney health.

These factors collectively contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the absence of certain other risk factors (e.g., family history of hypertension or diabetes, heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure) and the relatively preserved kidney function at the moment temper the risk, preventing it from being higher. Regular monitoring and management of the identified risk factors are essential to prevent or slow the progression of CKD.",74,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

* Elevated fasting glucose (186.3456292237024 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.715229984399539%) levels indicate poor glycemic control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
* Presence of protein in urine (0.295500688384836 g/day) and elevated ACR (220.169329544143 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
* History of UTIs, which can increase the risk of CKD.
* Elevated BMI (35.26091464039063) and low physical activity (3.109120288621783 hours/week) contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
* Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, may further increase the risk of CKD.
* Poor medication adherence (0.0145242512272847/10) and low frequency of medical checkups (0.7733302011160652/year) may hinder proper management of underlying conditions and CKD progression.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:

* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.
* Higher education level and moderate health literacy (7.8469341913551185/10), which may facilitate better health choices and disease management.

Overall, the combination of these factors results in a high risk score for CKD, emphasizing the need for closer monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and optimized management of underlying conditions to slow disease progression.",73,Asian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is moderately high, based on several factors:

- **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
- **Protein in Urine:** The presence of 3.57 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
- **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio):** An ACR of 33.91 mg/g suggests kidney damage.
- **GFR (Glucose Filtration Rate):** Although the GFR is within the normal range (86.33 mL/min/1.73 m²), it's on the lower end, indicating potential kidney function impairment.
- **Hypertension:** Systolic BP of 110 mmHg and diastolic BP of 91 mmHg are within a range that could be considered pre-hypertensive or mildly hypertensive, which can impact kidney health over time.
- **Medications and Health Behaviors:** The use of NSAIDs and antidiabetic medications, along with moderate adherence to medication and limited health literacy, may influence CKD risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD.

However, factors such as good diet quality, relatively high physical activity, and good sleep quality help to mitigate the risk to some extent. Regular medical check-ups are also a positive factor. Nonetheless, the combination of kidney damage indicators (proteinuria, ACR, previous AKI) and lifestyle factors contributes to the elevated risk score.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 80/100
Rationale
Age & Gender – 79‑year‑old female: age ≥ 75 adds ≈ +10 points.
Previous AKI – a prior acute kidney injury significantly elevates CKD risk (+10).
Proteinuria – 3.57 g/day is well above the 0–5 g/day range and is a strong predictor of progression (+15).
ACR – 33.9 mg/g is in the moderate‑microalbuminuria range, contributing another +10.
Blood Pressure – diastolic 91 mm Hg (border‑high) adds +5.
NSAID use – >7 times/week is a nephrotoxic exposure (+10).
Smoking – current smoker adds +5.
Medication adherence – low score (2.3/10) suggests suboptimal control of comorbidities (+5).
Positive mitigating factors – normal BMI, good diet quality, adequate sleep, and normal fasting glucose/HbA1c reduce risk slightly (‑5).

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors:

* Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury): Yes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
* Protein in urine: 3.57 g/day, and ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) 33.91 mg/g, indicating significant proteinuria, a sign of kidney damage.
* High blood pressure readings (110/91 mmHg), although not extremely high, still pose a risk factor for CKD.
* Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, while not diabetic, are on the higher end, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which can impact kidney health.
* The patient's history of antidiabetic medication use implies a level of glucose metabolism concern.
* Reduced kidney function is also indicated by a GFR of 86.33 mL/min/1.73 m², which, although within a relatively normal range, is on the lower end, especially considering the patient's other health metrics.
* Other factors such as smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and relatively low diet quality may also contribute to the increased risk score.

However, factors that mitigate this risk include:
- The patient's BMI is within a healthy range (23.68), reducing the risk associated with obesity.
- Physical activity levels are moderate (4.68 hours/week), which is beneficial for overall health, including kidney health.
- Sleep quality is relatively good (7.71/10), which can positively impact health outcomes.

Given these considerations, the risk score of 74/100 reflects a concerning level of risk for developing or worsening CKD, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and adherence to medical recommendations.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered include:

1. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD.
2. **Family History:** The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes slightly reduces the risk but is counterbalanced by other factors.
3. **Blood Pressure:** Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (144/97 mmHg) is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c:** The values (124.13950346936473 mg/dL and 6.063478535102732%, respectively) indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Parameters:** The creatinine level (1.460764276902391 mg/dL), BUN level (11.026806234336068 mg/dL), and GFR (106.74334033289358 mL/min/1.73 m²) are within or close to abnormal ranges, indicating potential kidney stress or early damage.
6. **Proteinuria:** The presence of protein in the urine (3.77046579132431 g/day) with an ACR of 249.11665980922857 mg/g is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
7. **Medications:** The use of ACE inhibitors may be protective but also indicates the presence of hypertension or proteinuria, which are risk factors.
8. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors:** While the BMI (21.340390690964103) and physical activity level (4.578352625580687 hours/week) are favorable, the diet quality (2.244252224955331/10) and health literacy (2.895606201303332/10) are low, potentially contributing to increased risk.
9. **Symptoms:** The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a high-quality sleep score, indicates some impact on quality of life but does not directly increase the risk score for CKD.

2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, previous AKI plays a significant role.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (144/97 mmHg) is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels are slightly elevated, indicating potential glucose metabolism issues, which can be a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function (GFR and Creatinine)**: The estimated GFR is within the normal range, but the creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
6. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.77046579132431 g/day) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which can be protective, but also the presence of previous AKI and proteinuria, suggests a need for careful management.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: A relatively healthy BMI, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and regular physical activity are positive factors, but diet quality could be improved.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk score:

1. **Age and Gender**: At 67 years old, age is a significant risk factor for CKD. Being female also has implications for CKD risk, though generally, men are at higher risk.

2. **Medical History**: A history of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) increases the risk of developing CKD. The absence of family histories of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes somewhat mitigates this risk but does not eliminate it.

3. **Clinical Measurements**: 
   - **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (144/97 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Slightly elevated fasting glucose (124.13950346936473 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.063478535102732%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - **Renal Function**: The estimated GFR (106.74334033289358 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicates good kidney function, but the presence of protein in the urine (3.77046579132431 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (249.11665980922857 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
   - **Electrolytes and Lipids**: While within normal ranges, careful management of electrolytes and lipids is important for overall cardiovascular and renal health.

4. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**:
   - **Physical Activity**: Moderate physical activity (4.578352625580687 hours/week) is beneficial.
   - **Diet Quality**: A diet quality score of 2.244252224955331/10 suggests room for improvement, as a healthy diet is crucial for managing risk factors for CKD.
   - **Medication Adherence**: High adherence (8.724187356905/10) to prescribed medications, including ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medications, is beneficial for managing related conditions.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.19 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys should filter out large molecules like proteins.
3. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 59.65 mg/g is higher than normal, further indicating kidney damage and increasing the risk of CKD progression.
4. **Low Hemoglobin**: A hemoglobin level of 10.18 g/dL is below the normal range, which could indicate anemia, a common complication of CKD.
5. **Use of Diuretics and NSAIDs**: While these medications can be necessary, their use, especially NSAIDs at a frequency of 7.47 times/week, can be nephrotoxic and increase the risk of kidney damage over time.
6. **Symptoms**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue (5.45/10), frequent muscle cramps (4.035 times/week), and itching (6.77/10) are all symptoms that can be associated with CKD, suggesting potential kidney dysfunction.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate this risk include:
- **Normal Blood Pressure**: A systolic BP of 96 mmHg and diastolic BP of 68 mmHg are within a healthy range, reducing the risk of hypertension-induced kidney damage.
- **Good Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: A diet quality score of 6.66/10 and physical activity of 7.11 hours/week are positive lifestyle factors.
- **No History of AKI or UTIs**: The absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs) reduces the risk of CKD.

Overall, while there are both risk-increasing and risk-reducing factors, the presence of significant proteinuria, family history of diabetes, and symptoms suggestive of kidney dysfunction contribute to an elevated risk score for CKD.",74,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 72/100
Brief Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD Risk
Comment
Age 48
Moderate
CKD risk increases with age, but 48 is still early for major decline.
Race – Black
High
Black individuals have a higher baseline risk for CKD progression.
BMI 17.8
Low muscle mass → high creatinine per body size
Low BMI may over‑estimate creatinine, but the high creatinine value (4.97 mg/dL) signals impaired filtration.
Proteinuria 3.19 g/day
Very high
Heavy protein loss strongly predicts CKD progression.
ACR 59.7 mg/g
Moderate‑high
Indicates significant albumin excretion.
GFR 91.8 mL/min/1.73 m²
Normal‑to‑low end
Suggests early or mild CKD, but inconsistent with creatinine.
HbA1c 7.5 %
High
Poor glycemic control accelerates kidney damage.
NSAID use 7–8×/week
High
Frequent NSAIDs can cause nephrotoxicity and worsen proteinuria.
Diuretics
Neutral to slightly harmful
Can exacerbate volume shifts but not a primary CKD driver.
Edema, fatigue, itching
Symptoms of advanced CKD
Reflect fluid overload, anemia, and uremic pruritus.
Low QoL Score (2.85/100)
Indicator of significant morbidity
May reflect underlying CKD burden.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease
* Elevated creatinine level (4.97 mg/dL) and protein in urine (3.19 g/day), indicating impaired kidney function
* Presence of edema, fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, which are common symptoms of kidney disease
* Low hemoglobin level (10.18 g/dL), which may indicate anemia related to kidney disease
* Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can affect kidney function
* Relatively low GFR (91.82 mL/min/1.73 m²) for someone with no previous AKI or UTIs
* Poor quality of life score (2.85/100), which may be related to underlying kidney disease

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:

* No family history of kidney disease or hypertension
* No previous AKI or UTIs
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals
* High health literacy and moderate medication adherence

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history increases the risk of CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 175 mmHg is significantly elevated, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A level of 189.79548452199825 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Indicators**: While the GFR is within the normal range (96.18082789833768 mL/min/1.73 m²), the presence of protein in the urine (0.1637724205832935 g/day) and an elevated ACR (233.3070167910547 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
5. **High BMI**: A BMI of 36.88428158318083 is classified as obese, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
6. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the low adherence to medication and relatively low health literacy may hinder the effectiveness of treatment.
7. **Lack of Other Chronic Conditions**: The absence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, as well as no previous AKI or UTIs, slightly mitigates the risk but does not outweigh the existing risk factors.

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Hypertension**: A systolic blood pressure of 175 mmHg indicates hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 189.79548452199825 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD risk.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.1637724205832935 g/day) is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 233.3070167910547 mg/g is elevated, indicating kidney damage and a higher risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the occasional use of NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, and the relatively low medication adherence score (2.0086454705573695/10) may negatively impact kidney health.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (36.88428158318083) and relatively low physical activity level (1.9643190907274033 hours/week) can also contribute to CKD risk.

However, factors such as good water quality, no heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure, and a relatively high diet quality score (8.299223129834905/10) may somewhat mitigate the risk. Overall, the combination of genetic predisposition, hypertension, indicators of kidney damage, and lifestyle factors contributes to a significant risk score for chronic kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 75/100**

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk.
2. **Current Kidney Function**: The patient's GFR (105.2183944096887 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in urine (3.2003596224357738 g/day) and elevated ACR (108.28020971769833 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
3. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic BP (132 mmHg) is slightly elevated, which can increase the risk of CKD progression.
4. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD patients, but the use of diuretics and NSAIDs (6.822815134417629 times/week) may have adverse effects on kidney function.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's diet quality (0.0980811471397635/10) is poor, and physical activity (6.997063557499188 hours/week) is relatively low, which may contribute to the risk.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The patient experiences fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which may indicate underlying kidney issues.
7. **Exposures**: Poor water quality may be a risk factor for CKD.
8. **Health Behaviors**: The patient's medication adherence (4.546055286798412/10) and health literacy (6.88490362060511/10) are moderate, which may impact disease management.

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Having a family history of kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 132 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 81 mmHg indicate elevated blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.2003596224357738 g/day of protein in urine is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
4. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 108.28020971769833 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as it indicates the presence of albumin in the urine, a common sign of kidney problems.
5. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics can be both protective and indicative of existing kidney issues or hypertension management.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the lack of smoking is positive, the high BMI and relatively low diet quality could contribute to CKD risk.
7. **Electrolytes and Renal Function**: The elevated potassium level (5.08548536872193 mEq/L) could indicate impaired kidney function, although other electrolytes and the GFR (105.2183944096887 mL/min/1.73 m²) are within relatively normal ranges.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, may reflect kidney dysfunction and its impact on overall health.

Low
Normal kidney filtration, partially offsets other risks.
BP 132/81 mmHg
Mildly elevated
Hypertension is a leading CKD driver.
NSAID use ~7 ×/wk
High
Chronic NSAID exposure damages renal vasculature.
Alcohol 19 units/week

Near upper limit; adds mild metabolic stress.
BMI 27.2
Mild
Overweight status can contribute to CKD progression.
Medications
ACE‑I + diuretics
ACE‑I is renoprotective; diuretic may worsen electrolyte balance.
Other labs (normal electrolytes, hemoglobin low)
Small
Mild anemia may reflect early kidney dysfunction.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:

- Family history of kidney disease, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
- Elevated protein in urine (3.2003596224357738 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 108.28020971769833 mg/g, indicating kidney damage.
- High blood pressure (132/81 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
- The use of NSAIDs (6.822815134417629 times/week), which can be harmful to kidney function with frequent use.
- Poor water quality, which may expose individuals to harmful substances that can affect kidney health.
- Suboptimal diet quality (0.0980811471397635/10), which can contribute to the development of CKD.
- High BMI (27.20774107064613), indicating overweight status, which is a risk factor for CKD.

However, factors such as the absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI), UTIs, and good sleep quality (7.4972294321713076/10) slightly mitigate the risk. Regular medical checkups (1.098353138632565/year) and relatively good medication adherence (4.546055286798412/10) are also positive factors.

The rationale for this risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and laboratory results. Main points considered include:
- Family history of kidney disease, which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- Elevated protein in urine (3.2003596224357738 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 108.28020971769833 mg/g, both of which are indicators of kidney damage.
- The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which could be indicative of existing kidney issues or hypertension.
- A relatively low GFR (105.2183944096887 mL/min/1.73 m²) for someone without other significant kidney issues, though still within the normal range.
- Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, which could be symptoms related to kidney function or other underlying conditions.
- Poor water quality exposure, which might contribute to kidney stress over time.
- High blood pressure (132/81 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
- Elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, which can contribute to cardiovascular disease and indirectly affect kidney health.

However, factors that might mitigate the risk include:
- No previous AKI or UTIs.
- No family history of hypertension or diabetes.
- Relatively good sleep quality and high socioeconomic status, which might facilitate better healthcare management.
- The absence of edema.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a moderately high risk for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and management of blood pressure, proteinuria, and other risk factors to prevent disease progression.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**  

**Rationale – main points**  
1. **Proteinuria & ACR** – 3.2 g/day protein and an ACR of 108 mg/g are strongly predictive of current kidney injury and future CKD progression.  
2. **NSAID use** – 6–7 times/week increases renal stress and contributes to acute‑on‑chronic damage.

The provided risk score is based on the individual's comprehensive health profile. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a known risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The individual's systolic blood pressure (168 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (103 mmHg) are elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.402 mg/dL and a GFR of 64.19 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function. These values suggest that the kidneys are not functioning at optimal levels, which increases the risk of CKD progression.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.128 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage and a risk factor for CKD progression.
5. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 100.333 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage, as it indicates albumin leakage into the urine, a common sign of kidney dysfunction.
6. **Other Health Factors**: While the individual does not have a history of kidney disease, hypertension, or previous AKI, the presence of factors like high BMI (33.18), elevated fasting glucose (95.62 mg/dL), and use of diuretics and NSAIDs contribute to the overall risk profile. High BMI and elevated fasting glucose can increase the risk of developing conditions that affect kidney health.
7. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors**: Limited physical activity (0.479 hours/week), although the diet quality is good (9.54/10), and moderate alcohol consumption (15.52 units/week) can influence kidney health and disease progression.

The combination of these factors, particularly the presence of hypertension, impaired kidney function (as indicated by creatinine and GFR levels), and proteinuria, significantly increases the risk of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, monitoring and management of these risk factors through lifestyle modifications and medical interventions are crucial to prevent or slow the progression of CKD.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points that contribute to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (168/103 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Laboratory Results**: The patient's creatinine level (2.402285747836958 mg/dL) and GFR (64.18673160311079 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. The protein in urine (1.1284372569026435 g/day) and ACR (100.33316276132702 mg/g) are also elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
4. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs may worsen kidney function, especially with frequent use of NSAIDs (7.462275949700789 times/week).
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the patient's diet quality and sleep quality are good, the physical activity level is low (0.4792517595602408 hours/week), and the BMI is high (33.17761122646267), which can contribute to the development of CKD.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The patient experiences fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which can be symptoms of CKD. The QoL score is also relatively low (21.4621551191174/100).

The provided risk score is based on the individual's medical history, lifestyle, and current health status. The main points contributing to this score include:

* Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (168/103 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
* High BMI (33.17761122646267), indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* Elevated creatinine levels (2.402285747836958 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (64.18673160311079 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (1.1284372569026435 g/day) and elevated ACR (100.33316276132702 mg/g), which are indicators of kidney damage.
* History of diuretic use, which can be a risk factor for CKD if not properly managed.
* Low physical activity (0.4792517595602408 hours/week) and high alcohol consumption (15.520443568804891 units/week), which can contribute to CKD risk.

The provided risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the analysis of various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. Key points influencing this risk score include:

1. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure (176/105 mmHg) is significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could lower the risk, the absence of these does not negate the presence of other risk-increasing factors.
3. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's alcohol consumption (9.53 units/week) and physical activity level (2.5 hours/week) might not be significantly contributing to the risk, given the moderate consumption and some level of physical activity. However, diet quality (3.19/10) is relatively low, which could negatively impact kidney health.
4. **Clinical Measurements**: The patient's fasting glucose (95.74 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.55%) indicate prediabetes, a condition that increases the risk of developing CKD. The GFR (118.07 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (ACR 279.07 mg/g) is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the total cholesterol (247.99 mg/dL) and triglycerides (228.18 mg/dL) are elevated, which could contribute to cardiovascular risk factors that also impact kidney health.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, especially in the context of hypertension and proteinuria. However, the presence of fatigue, itching, and a relatively low QoL score may indicate some level of kidney dysfunction or other underlying health issues.
7. **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups is low (0.41 times/year), which could delay the detection and management of kidney disease, potentially increasing the risk.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a significant risk of developing or progressing CKD, primarily due to uncontrolled hypertension, indicators of kidney damage (proteinuria), and other cardiovascular risk factors.",73,African American,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 70/100**

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **High Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 176 mmHg and diastolic BP of 105 mmHg are significantly higher than the normal range, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes mentioned, the absence of these does not significantly reduce the risk given the presence of other factors.
3. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated fasting glucose (95.744 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.551%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to the development of CKD. The creatinine level is within the normal range, but the BUN level is slightly elevated. The GFR is above normal, but the presence of protein in the urine (0.0168 g/day) and an elevated ACR (279.067 mg/g) are indicators of kidney stress or damage.
4. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are mostly within normal ranges, but the total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and indirectly to CKD progression.
5. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the frequent use of NSAIDs (6.3 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, suggests current health issues that could be related to or exacerbate CKD.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups and less than perfect medication adherence could hinder the management of CKD risk factors.

Given these considerations, the risk score of 73/100 indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, primarily driven by uncontrolled hypertension, signs of kidney damage (proteinuria and elevated ACR), and lifestyle factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk score:

1. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (176/105 mmHg) are significantly higher than the recommended levels, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors compensates for this in the risk calculation.
3. **Laboratory Results**: The fasting glucose level is at the higher end of normal, and the HbA1c is slightly elevated, indicating possible prediabetic conditions, which can contribute to CKD risk. The creatinine level is within normal limits, but the BUN level is somewhat elevated. The GFR is within the normal range but on the higher side, which might not directly indicate CKD but suggests the kidneys are working harder than average, possibly due to the high blood pressure.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.0168042759096465 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR of 279.0671203174806 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage or disease, even though the ACR is just below the upper limit of the range provided.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While the electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, the total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, and the LDL cholesterol is near the upper limit of the normal range. These factors can contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to CKD risk.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for blood pressure control and kidney protection, but the concurrent use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, may pose some risk to kidney function due to their potential to reduce renal blood flow.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, itching, and a moderate quality of life score suggests some impact on daily life that could be related to underlying health issues, including potential CKD.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups are infrequent, which could delay the detection and management of kidney",73,African American,Black,"**Risk Score: 72/100**

**Brief Rationale**

- **Age & Ethnicity** – At 81 and Black, baseline risk for CKD is elevated.  
- **Hypertension** – Systolic 176 mmHg and diastolic 105 mmHg are markedly above target, strongly driving kidney damage.  
- **Albuminuria** – ACR of 279 mg/g is near the upper limit of the “moderately increased” range; persistent micro‑albuminuria is a powerful predictor of CKD progression.  
- **Medication & NSAID exposure** – ACE‑inhibitor therapy helps protect kidneys, but frequent NSAID use (≈6 times/week) counteracts this benefit and can precipitate acute worsening.  
- **Other metabolic factors** – HbA1c 6.55 % and triglycerides 228 mg/dL add modest metabolic risk, though fasting glucose is near normal.  
- **Renal function** – Current eGFR is normal (118 mL/min/1.73 m²), but the combination of high BP, albuminuria, and NSAID use indicates a trajectory toward decline.  

Overall, the patient has several modifiable risk factors (blood pressure, NSAID use) but also some protective factors (ACE inhibitor, statin therapy). A score around 70‑75 % reflects a **moderately high** risk of CKD progression that warrants intensified monitoring and lifestyle modifications.",72.0,African American,Black

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered are:

1. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (176/105 mmHg) is significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Albuminuria**: The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is 279.0671203174806 mg/g, which indicates the presence of albuminuria, a key marker for kidney damage.
3. **Family History**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the absence of these does not significantly reduce the risk given the presence of other strong risk factors.
4. **Laboratory Values**: The patient's creatinine and GFR levels are within relatively normal ranges, but the elevated BUN level and the presence of protein in the urine are indicators of kidney stress or damage.
5. **Lifestyle and Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for managing hypertension and reducing proteinuria, but the patient's NSAIDs usage could potentially exacerbate kidney issues due to its effects on renal function.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The patient reports significant fatigue and itching, which can be associated with CKD, especially in advanced stages.

Given these factors, the patient is at a significant risk for developing or worsening chronic kidney disease, primarily due to uncontrolled hypertension, albuminuria, and potential kidney damage indicated by laboratory values and symptoms. Effective management of blood pressure, monitoring of kidney function, and adjustment of medications (including careful use of NSAIDs) are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: **63/100**

The high risk score is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Low GFR (17.776187722760874 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: Indicative of significantly impaired kidney function.
2. **High Creatinine (4.382068607141651 mg/dL)** and **BUN Level (26.975723408631147 mg/dL)**: These values suggest poor kidney function.
3. **Presence of Protein in Urine (1.5098606887092303 g/day)** and a high **ACR (148.95722236955058 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a significant marker of kidney damage.
4. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's current health metrics (e.g., high fasting glucose, HbA1c, and blood pressure) indicate the presence of conditions that can worsen kidney function over time.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Despite a relatively healthy BMI and physical activity level, poor diet quality, and moderate alcohol consumption could contribute to kidney stress.
6. **Symptoms**: Frequent nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and significant fatigue are concerning for advanced kidney disease, affecting quality of life and potentially indicating electrolyte imbalances or uremia.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for patients with kidney disease, but the absence of statins (despite high cholesterol) and antidiabetic medications (given elevated glucose levels) could indicate undertreatment of conditions that impact kidney health. Poor health literacy and less frequent medical check-ups may also hinder optimal disease management.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to the following factors:
- Elevated creatinine levels (4.382 mg/dL) and low GFR (17.776 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
- Presence of protein in urine (1.509 g/day) and high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR 148.957 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
- History of using ACE inhibitors may indicate previous concerns about hypertension or kidney protection, but the absence of other protective medications like statins and the use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidneys, contribute to the risk.
- The patient's fasting glucose (159.561 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.077%) levels are elevated, suggesting poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
- Low health literacy (1.381/10) and moderate medication adherence (7.864/10) might hinder the patient's ability to manage their condition effectively, further increasing the risk.
- Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching are consistent with advanced CKD, contributing to the high risk score.

The provided risk score for chronic kidney disease is based on the analysis of various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **High BMI (38.45)**: Indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the increased risk of diabetes and hypertension.
2. **Smoking and High Alcohol Consumption (7.61 units/week)**: Both are harmful to kidney health, with smoking being a direct risk factor for CKD and alcohol potentially exacerbating kidney damage.
3. **Low Diet Quality (1.73/10) and Low Physical Activity (5.43 hours/week)**: Poor diet and insufficient physical activity can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which are risk factors for CKD.
4. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections can increase the risk of kidney damage and CKD.
5. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated fasting glucose (105.69 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.79%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD. The slightly elevated creatinine level (4.29 mg/dL) and low GFR (113.97 mL/min/1.73 m²) may indicate mild kidney impairment, but the GFR is still within a relatively normal range for many laboratories, considering the fluctuations in this measurement. The presence of protein in the urine (0.48 g/day) and an elevated ACR (64.84 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some electrolytes and cholesterol levels are within normal ranges, the high total cholesterol (260.55 mg/dL) and triglycerides (209.53 mg/dL) can contribute to cardiovascular risk factors, which are also relevant to CKD progression.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs could influence kidney function, and symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching may reflect underlying kidney issues or other health problems.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups and high medication adherence are positive factors, but low health literacy could hinder the management of health conditions.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.290140877964141 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range (0.5-1.2 mg/dL for males), indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 0.4801840594069229 g/day of protein in the urine suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys normally prevent large molecules like proteins from being filtered into the urine.
3. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 64.84457851259644 mg/g is elevated, indicating kidney damage. The ACR is a critical marker for detecting early kidney damage and monitoring disease progression.
4. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (123/65 mmHg) are not in the hypertensive range, the use of diuretics suggests that blood pressure management might be an issue, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Family and Medical History**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of UTIs (urinary tract infections) can be a risk factor for CKD, as recurrent infections can damage the kidneys over time.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 38.45134633884824 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for developing CKD. Smoking and alcohol consumption (7.611743897955341 units/week) also contribute to the risk, as they can impair kidney function.
7. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated fasting glucose (105.6934080391607 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.789841139550079%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD risk. High total cholesterol and triglycerides also pose cardiovascular risks that can indirectly affect kidney health.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for lifestyle modifications, close monitoring of kidney function, and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage associated risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.",74,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 83/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: With a creatinine level of 4.290140877964141 mg/dL, which is near the upper limit of the range (0.5-5.0), this indicates compromised kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 0.4801840594069229 g/day of protein in the urine suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not typically allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
3. **High Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 64.84457851259644 mg/g is a strong indicator of kidney damage, specifically nephropathy, which is a common cause of CKD.
4. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) can increase the risk of developing CKD over time due to potential kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the physical activity level is relatively high, the diet quality is low (1.7293151463944534/10), which can negatively impact overall health and kidney function. The high BMI (38.45134633884824) also increases the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which are major risk factors for CKD.
6. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and consuming alcohol (7.611743897955341 units/week) can further exacerbate kidney damage and increase the risk of CKD.

Despite some protective factors such as relatively good blood pressure control and the absence of certain harmful exposures, the cumulative effect of the aforementioned risk factors significantly elevates the risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring and management of these risk factors, along with adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications, are crucial to mitigate the progression of kidney disease.",83,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: **82/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Age and Gender**: Being 72 years old and female, both are significant risk factors for CKD.
2. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk but does not eliminate it.
3. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 30.76 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor. Smoking and alcohol consumption (18.66 units/week) also increase the risk. Physical activity (6.18 hours/week) is somewhat mitigating but may not be sufficient to counterbalance other risk factors.
4. **Medical History and Current Conditions**: No previous AKI or UTIs, but the presence of elevated blood pressure (138/95 mmHg), borderline fasting glucose (105.93 mg/dL), and slightly elevated HbA1c (5.79%) suggest metabolic and cardiovascular strain.
5. **Kidney Function**: The creatinine level (4.99 mg/dL) and BUN (17.91 mg/dL) are within ranges that may not immediately indicate severe kidney impairment, but the GFR (119.84 mL/min/1.73 m²) is near the upper limit of normal, and protein in urine (0.0044 g/day) with an ACR of 191.75 mg/g suggests some kidney stress.
6. **Medications**: Use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension and possible early signs of kidney issues.
7. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Levels are mostly within normal ranges but indicate potential for further metabolic and cardiovascular stress.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a relatively high QoL score, suggests some impact on daily life but an overall high quality of life.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (138/95 mmHg) which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* High creatinine level (4.989843776496995 mg/dL) indicating impaired kidney function.
* Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 191.7512465751462 mg/g, which is elevated and suggests kidney damage.
* Presence of protein in urine, although minimal (0.0044086345406035 g/day), is still a risk factor.
* Family history of kidney disease is denied, but the presence of other risk factors compensates for this.
* The patient's BMI (30.76044045953386) is in the obese range, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
* Smoking and alcohol consumption (18.662717368124373 units/week) are additional risk factors.
* The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests that the patient is being treated for conditions (likely hypertension) that can affect kidney function.
* Good health literacy and medication adherence are positive factors but do not outweigh the aforementioned risks.

These factors cumulatively contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, hence the risk score of 74/100.

1. **Kidney Function:** The elevated creatinine level (4.99 mg/dL) and the relatively high ACR (191.75 mg/g) suggest impaired kidney function, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

2. **Blood Pressure:** The systolic and diastolic blood pressures (138/95 mmHg) are higher than the ideal range, indicating hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.

3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c:** The fasting glucose level (105.93 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.79%) are near the upper limits of normal, suggesting pre-diabetic conditions, which can increase the risk of developing CKD.

4. **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking and high alcohol consumption (18.66 units/week) are harmful to kidney health. Although the diet quality is moderate (6.20/10) and physical activity is somewhat adequate (6.18 hours/week), these factors do not significantly mitigate the risks posed by other factors.

5. **Medications:** The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension and possible CKD, but frequent NSAIDs use (6.99 times/week) can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney damage.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life:** Fatigue (7.37/10), nausea/vomiting (0.90 times/week), muscle cramps (1.29 times/week), and itching (2.18/10) could be indicative of uremic symptoms related to kidney dysfunction, though the overall QoL score is relatively high (92.94/100).

The risk score of 73 out of 100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors from the provided medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **High Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 138 mmHg and diastolic BP of 95 mmHg are above the normal range, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
2. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.989843776496995 mg/dL is near the upper limit of the normal range, indicating potential kidney stress or early kidney damage.
3. **High Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 191.7512465751462 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as it indicates the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is a marker of kidney damage.
4. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and no previous AKI or UTIs, the presence of other risk factors (like high blood pressure and kidney damage markers) still poses a significant risk.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and alcohol consumption (18.662717368124373 units/week) are harmful to kidney health. A high BMI (30.76044045953386) also increases the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which are risk factors for CKD.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may be indicative of hypertension management, and NSAIDs can be harmful to kidney function if used excessively.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms like fatigue (7.3682482316222195/10) and itching (2.178407620704519/10) could be indicative of underlying kidney issues, although their severity and impact on quality of life are moderate.

Despite good health behaviors (regular medical checkups, high medication adherence, and good health literacy), the presence of several risk factors and indicators of kidney stress or damage contribute to a moderate to high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, lifestyle modifications (including cessation of smoking, reduction in alcohol consumption, and weight management), and careful use of medications are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 82/100
Rationale – Key risk contributors
Factor
Why it raises CKD risk
Elevated creatinine (≈5 mg/dL)
Direct marker of impaired filtration; usually signals advanced CKD even if eGFR is “normal” in the report.
High albumin‑creatinine ratio (191 mg/g)
Persistent micro‑albuminuria (30–300 mg/g) is a strong predictor of renal progression.
Hypertension (138/95 mmHg)
Poorly controlled BP accelerates glomerular damage; diuretics and ACE‑inhibitor use suggest prior attempts to manage it.
Obesity (BMI ≈ 31)
Adds metabolic stress and contributes to hypertension and insulin resistance.
Smoking & frequent NSAID use
Both increase intrarenal vasoconstriction and exacerbate inflammation.
Pre‑diabetes (HbA1c ≈ 5.8%)
Even mild hyperglycemia can worsen renal function over time.
Dyslipidemia (LDL ≈ 192 mg/dL)
Lipid abnormalities are linked to vascular damage, including renal microvasculature.
Age 72 and female
Age is the most powerful independent risk factor; post‑menopausal women are more susceptible to CKD progression.
Moderate‑to‑poor sleep quality & fatigue
May reflect early CKD symptoms and reduce overall health‑management capacity.
Overall, the combination of laboratory abnormalities (high creatinine & ACR), clinical risk factors (age, hypertension, obesity, smoking, NSAID use), and metabolic derangements pushes this patient into a high‑risk category for chronic kidney disease progression.",82.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided patient profile. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD. This is because AKI can lead to chronic damage and scarring in the kidneys, reducing their ability to function properly over time.

2. **Family History and Other Medical Conditions**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient has a history of UTIs, which can increase the risk of CKD by causing recurring damage to the kidneys.

3. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure is slightly elevated (141 mmHg), which is a risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time, reducing their function.

4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The patient's fasting glucose (111.756 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.2416%) levels are elevated, indicating poor glucose control. Diabetes is a major risk factor for CKD, as high blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys.

5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The patient's creatinine level is elevated (4.098 mg/dL), and the GFR is slightly below the normal range (82.11 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (0.449 g/day) and an elevated ACR (257.46 mg/g) also suggest kidney damage.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's smoking habit and moderate alcohol consumption are additional risk factors. Smoking can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and increase the risk of kidney disease, while excessive alcohol consumption can also harm kidney function.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The patient is on ACE inhibitors, which is beneficial for protecting kidney function, especially in the context of diabetes or high blood pressure. However, the use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) and UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections):** A history of AKI and UTIs can increase the risk of developing CKD, as these conditions can cause damage to the kidneys.

2. **Laboratory Results:** Elevated creatinine levels (4.098175793731415 mg/dL) and a relatively low GFR (82.11311916095457 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (0.4493140055875505 g/day) and a high ACR (257.45634411309186 mg/g) also suggest kidney damage.

3. **Hypertension and Diabetes Control:** Although there's no family history of hypertension or diabetes, the current systolic BP (141 mmHg) is elevated, and HbA1c (8.241592178813942%) is slightly high, indicating suboptimal control of blood glucose levels. Both hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for CKD.

4. **Lifestyle Factors:** A high BMI (29.075323579291577) and smoking history contribute to the risk of developing CKD. While physical activity is relatively high (9.6929466204908 hours/week), diet quality is moderate (5.604553467327163/10), and sleep quality is average (5.742165476849172/10), indicating areas for improvement.

5. **Medications and Health Behaviors:** The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the occasional use of NSAIDs could potentially harm kidney function. High adherence to medication and good health literacy are positive factors.

6. **Lipid Profile:** Elevated total cholesterol (201.8333525180364 mg/dL) and triglycerides (228.3073789778485 mg/dL) may contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to CKD risk.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and health behaviors. Key factors contributing to this score include:

- **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI and UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) suggests a predisposition to kidney issues.
- **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and moderate alcohol use can exacerbate kidney disease.
- **Physical Activity and Diet Quality**: While physical activity is relatively high, the diet quality score is average, which could be improved to reduce the risk of CKD progression.
- **Medical Conditions and Lab Results**: Elevated fasting glucose, HbA1c, and creatinine levels indicate impaired glucose regulation and reduced kidney function. The GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is within the normal range but on the lower end, suggesting potential early kidney damage.
- **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The presence of slightly elevated sodium, normal potassium, and abnormal lipid profiles (high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) can contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to kidney disease.
- **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and statins indicates management of conditions like hypertension and high cholesterol, which can help mitigate CKD risk but also suggests the presence of these conditions.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, may indicate CKD symptoms.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, adherence to medication, regular medical check-ups, and high health literacy are positive factors that can help manage and potentially reduce the risk of CKD progression.",73,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 85/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The high fasting glucose level (182.86288685285749 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.979996361568947%) indicate poorly controlled diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure (150 mmHg) is elevated, and although the diastolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.832535320938878 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 225.88696977921495 mg/g suggest kidney damage, which is a key indicator of CKD.
5. **Poor Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The low diet quality score (2.503993138656403/10) and moderate physical activity level (6.788463850288614 hours/week) may contribute to the overall health status and risk of CKD, although their direct impact on CKD risk is less clear compared to other factors.
6. **History of UTIs**: The history of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD, as recurrent infections can cause kidney damage over time.
7. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality may also pose additional health risks, including to kidney health, although the direct link to CKD is less defined compared to other risk factors.

These factors contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Management of diabetes, hypertension, and reduction of proteinuria, along with lifestyle modifications such as improved diet quality, increased physical activity, and good hydration with clean water, are crucial in mitigating this risk. Regular medical check-ups and adherence to prescribed medications can also play a significant role in managing and reducing the risk of CKD progression.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

- **Family History of Diabetes**: A family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as it increases the likelihood of developing conditions that can affect kidney function.
- **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg is above the normal range, which can damage kidneys over time.
- **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 182.86 mg/dL and 8.98%, respectively, indicate poor glucose control, which is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
- **Presence of Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: 2.83 g/day is a significant amount, suggesting kidney damage.
- **Low GFR is Not Present**: Despite other risk factors, the GFR of 111.58 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, which is a positive indicator.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 29.16 indicates overweight status, which can increase the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension that affect kidney health. The diet quality score of 2.50/10 is poor, which may contribute to various health issues, including kidney disease.
- **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, although not frequent, can affect kidney function, and poor water quality may also contribute to kidney disease risk.

- **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (182.86288685285749 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.979996361568947%) indicate poor blood sugar control, which can damage kidneys over time.
- ** Presence of Protein in Urine**: A significant amount of protein in the urine (2.832535320938878 g/day) and a high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (225.88696977921495 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
- **High Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (150 mmHg) can accelerate kidney damage.
- **Poor Diet Quality and Physical Inactivity**: While the physical activity level is moderate (6.788463850288614 hours/week), the diet quality is low (2.503993138656403/10), which can contribute to weight issues, as indicated by a BMI of 29.157403593102188, and increase the risk of developing conditions that can harm the kidneys.
- **Limited Health Literacy and Infrequent Medical Checkups**: Low health literacy (3.2041114525013956/10) and few medical checkups (0.3957562555432674/year) may hinder the management of risk factors and early detection of kidney issues.
- **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially expose the individual to unknown toxins that might affect kidney health.

However, the presence of some protective factors or less severe indicators, such as the absence of family kidney disease history, no previous AKI, relatively preserved GFR (111.58026506207511 mL/min/1.73 m²), and adherence to medications (8.219553917712044/10), prevent the risk score from being even higher.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily determined by several key factors present in the provided medical history and current health status. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: A positive family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor for developing kidney disease, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.

2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The glucose level of 182.86288685285749 mg/dL and HbA1c of 8.979996361568947% indicate poor glucose control, suggesting either undiagnosed or inadequately managed diabetes, both of which increase the risk of kidney damage.

3. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg is considered elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time.

4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 2.832535320938878 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.

5. **Poor Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: A diet quality score of 2.503993138656403/10 and moderate physical activity (6.788463850288614 hours/week) may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of CKD, especially in the context of other risk factors.

6. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections can increase the risk of kidney damage, especially if they reach the kidneys (pyelonephritis).

7. **Lipid Profile**: Elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides, alongside low HDL cholesterol, contribute to cardiovascular risk factors, which are also relevant to kidney health due to shared pathophysiological pathways.

8. **Suboptimal Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical check-ups and moderate health literacy may hinder timely detection and management of CKD risk factors.

9. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially increase the risk of certain kidney problems, depending on the contaminants present.

The risk score is based on the comprehensive data provided, which indicates several factors that contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 170 mmHg is significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine of 4.380303085678078 mg/dL and BUN of 47.19985460100338 mg/dL are indicators of impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: An ACR of 218.37422897158223 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to leak into the urine.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The elevated potassium level (5.166697223108952 mEq/L) could indicate reduced kidney function, as the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of NSAIDs (9.254450558977982 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with prolonged or excessive use.
7. **Symptoms**: Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of CKD, although they are nonspecific and can be associated with many conditions.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate this risk include:
- **Good Diet Quality**: A score of 9.383372026214593/10 for diet quality suggests a healthy dietary pattern, which can help in managing or slowing the progression of CKD.
- **High Physical Activity**: 8.510369385350225 hours/week of physical activity is beneficial for overall health and can help in managing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
- **Good Sleep Quality**: A high sleep quality score (9.921170215181297/10) is beneficial for overall health, including kidney health.
- **Statins Use**: The use of statins, given the high LDL cholesterol level, is beneficial for managing cardiovascular risk factors, which",74,African American,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 72/100
Rationale
Domain
Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
Blood pressure
Systolic 170 mmHg, diastolic 88 mmHg
Persistent hypertension is a leading driver of kidney injury; this reading is markedly elevated.
Renal biomarkers
Creatinine 4.38 mg/dL, BUN 47 mg/dL, GFR 110 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria 0.3 g/day, ACR 218 mg/g
The creatinine and BUN levels are high, but the GFR is surprisingly preserved, suggesting early or fluctuating injury. ACR > 200 mg/g is a strong indicator of glomerular damage.
Electrolytes
Potassium 5.17 mEq/L, phosphorus 4.20 mg/dL
Mild hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia reflect compromised tubular handling and early CKD changes.
Medication & exposures
NSAID use 9.3 ×/week, no ACEi/diuretic, statin therapy
Frequent NSAID consumption is nephrotoxic, especially when combined with high BP.
Metabolic profile
HbA1c 5.58 %, fasting glucose 82 mg/dL, family history of diabetes
While current glucose control is normal, a positive family history and pre‑diabetes range HbA1c raise future risk.
Lifestyle & demographics
BMI 27.8, low SES, high alcohol 12 units/wk, moderate physical activity (8.5 h/wk), excellent diet & sleep
BMI in overweight range and high alcohol use can exacerbate hypertension and renal strain; low socioeconomic status may limit access to preventive care.
Symptoms
Fatigue 8/10, nausea 5.6 ×/week, muscle cramps 3.2 ×/week, itching 3.9/10
These are typical of uremic toxin accumulation, supporting functional impairment.
Combining the above factors, the overall probability of chronic kidney disease progression in this individual is moderate to high. Therefore a risk score of 72/100 reflects substantial concern but not immediate end‑stage disease. Regular monitoring, blood‑pressure control, NSAID reduction, and early nephrology referral are recommended.",72.0,African American,Caucasian

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease is 74 out of 100. This assessment is based on several key factors from the provided data:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as it increases the likelihood of developing conditions that can impact kidney health, such as diabetes itself, which is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 170 mmHg is significantly higher than the normal range, putting additional strain on the kidneys and increasing the risk of kidney damage over time.

3. **Laboratory Results**: The creatinine level is at the higher end of the provided range, and the GFR, although within the normal range, indicates that the kidneys are still functioning well but could be under stress due to other factors like high blood pressure. The BUN level is also near the upper limit of the normal range, suggesting potential kidney strain.

4. **Electrolytes and Minerals**: The potassium level is at the upper limit of the normal range, which could indicate some level of kidney function impairment since the kidneys are responsible for regulating electrolyte balances.

5. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, although not exclusively indicative of CKD, can be associated with kidney dysfunction and contribute to the overall risk assessment.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The consumption of 12.42 units of alcohol per week and the use of NSAIDs approximately 9 times a week can both negatively impact kidney health and contribute to the risk of developing CKD.

7. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: While the diet quality is high and physical activity is significant, these positive lifestyle choices are somewhat offset by the higher BMI and alcohol consumption, which are risk factors for CKD.

8. **Medications**: The use of statins, while generally beneficial for cardiovascular health, in the context of other risk factors, may also indicate the presence of conditions (like high cholesterol) that can indirectly affect kidney health.

Given these factors, the risk score of 74 out of 100 reflects a significant risk of developing chronic kidney disease, primarily due to the combination of hypertension, family history of diabetes, elevated creatinine and BUN levels, and lifestyle factors.

The calculated risk score is based on various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health metrics. Main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Yes, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease, particularly diabetic nephropathy.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated at 170/88 mmHg, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) as high blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels.
3. **Creatinine Level**: At 4.380303085678078 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **GFR**: 109.54548888134806 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range but on the higher end, suggesting that while kidney function is currently within normal limits, other factors could be compensating for or masking potential kidney issues.
5. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: 218.37422897158223 mg/g, which is elevated, indicating kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some levels are within normal ranges, the presence of slightly elevated potassium and calcium levels, along with high total and LDL cholesterol, can contribute to vascular disease and, by extension, increase the risk to kidney health.
7. **Lack of Protective Medications**: Not being on ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which are commonly used to protect kidney function in individuals at risk, increases the risk score.
8. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use (9.254450558977982 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function over time.
9. **Symptoms and QoL**: Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a relatively lower QoL score, suggests current kidney function impact on overall health.

Despite good diet quality, sleep quality, and health literacy, the cumulative effect of the risk factors and lack of certain protective measures contribute to a moderate to high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, assessment of kidney function, and adjustment of medications (including potential initiation of renal protective drugs) are recommended to mitigate this risk.",64,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Renal function indicators
Elevated creatinine (~4.4 mg/dL) and proteinuria (~0.3 g/day) strongly suggest ongoing kidney injury.
Albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (ACR) of 218 mg/g sits at the upper end of the normal range (0–300 mg/g) and is a well‑established marker of glomerular damage.
GFR of 109 mL/min/1.73 m² appears discordant with the creatinine level; the combination points to a possible early stage of CKD with rapid decline risk.
Hypertension
Systolic BP of 170 mmHg is markedly elevated; uncontrolled high blood pressure accelerates CKD progression.
Electrolyte disturbance
Slight hyperkalemia (5.17 mEq/L) reflects impaired potassium excretion, a sign of decreased renal reserve.
Metabolic profile
Mildly high LDL (176 mg/dL) and triglycerides (195 mg/dL) add vascular risk to renal health.
Lifestyle / protective factors
No smoking, moderate alcohol use, high diet quality (9.4/10), excellent sleep quality, and good medication adherence reduce overall risk somewhat.
Overall assessment
The combination of significant proteinuria, hypertension, and elevated creatinine outweighs the protective lifestyle factors, yielding a moderate‑to‑high risk of CKD progression in a young adult. Hence the score of 78 / 100 reflects substantial concern but leaves room for improvement with aggressive management.",78.0,African American,Hispanic

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and symptoms. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* **Family history of hypertension and diabetes**: Increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: Indicates a history of kidney damage, which can predispose to CKD.
* **Elevated creatinine and BUN levels**: Suggests impaired kidney function.
* **Protein in urine (3.73 g/day) and high ACR (271.49 mg/g)**: Indicates kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
* **Suboptimal diet quality (7.05/10) and low physical activity (0.39 hours/week)**: Contributes to an increased risk of CKD.
* **History of NSAIDs use (5.29 times/week)**: May be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney damage.
* **Presence of symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching**: May indicate underlying kidney dysfunction.

However, some factors reduce the risk score, including:

* **Good water quality and no heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure**: Decreases the risk of environmental toxin-induced kidney damage.
* **Regular medical checkups (2.43 times/year) and good medication adherence (5.91/10)**: Suggests a proactive approach to health management.
* **Higher education and middle socioeconomic status**: May be associated with better health literacy and access to healthcare resources.

The calculated risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. Main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of CKD, as these conditions are major risk factors for kidney disease.
2. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD, as it can lead to chronic damage and reduce kidney function over time.
3. **Clinical Measures**:
   - **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is elevated, which could indicate potential vascular issues affecting kidney function.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: These values are within normal limits but on the higher end, suggesting careful monitoring is needed to prevent the onset of diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
   - **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is on the higher side, and while the GFR is within the normal range, the protein in urine and ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage or early signs of kidney disease.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**:
   - **Physical Activity**: Low levels of physical activity can contribute to a higher risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
   - **Diet Quality and Alcohol Consumption**: While diet quality is relatively good, alcohol consumption is near the upper limit of the moderate drinking range, which could potentially affect kidney health.
5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching could be indicative of underlying kidney issues, though these symptoms are non-specific and can have many causes.

Overall, the combination of genetic predispositions, previous kidney injury, borderline clinical measures, and lifestyle factors contribute to an elevated risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring of kidney function, blood pressure, and glucose levels, along with adjustments to lifestyle factors such as increased physical activity and careful management of alcohol intake, are recommended to mitigate this risk.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Renal function markers – Elevated creatinine (≈2.9 mg/dL) and BUN (≈47 mg/dL) with significant proteinuria (3.73 g/day) and an albumin‑creatinine ratio near the upper limit of normal (≈271 mg/g) indicate active kidney injury and a high likelihood of chronic progression.
Blood pressure profile – While systolic BP is acceptable, the diastolic value (108 mmHg) is above normal, suggesting hypertension‑related glomerular stress.
Prior AKI episode – History of acute kidney injury is a well‑documented risk factor for subsequent CKD.
Family history – Positive for hypertension and diabetes, both major drivers of kidney damage.
Lifestyle factors – Moderate alcohol use (≈17 units/week) and low physical activity increase cardiovascular and metabolic burden, which can aggravate renal decline.
Metabolic profile – Slightly elevated triglycerides and LDL, although total cholesterol is within range, hint at underlying vascular risk that may impair renal perfusion.
Overall assessment – The combination of impaired filtration markers, proteinuria, hypertension, and prior kidney insults places this individual at a moderately‑high risk for CKD progression, justifying a score of ~80/100.",78.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The patient's high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.838103182955485 mg/dL and a GFR of 37.52081557638384 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR is significantly below the normal range, suggesting a substantial loss of kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.6182208405497278 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
3. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure of 162 mmHg is above the recommended levels, and hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidneys over time.
4. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 139.877305802914 mg/dL and 7.262473868880481%, respectively, indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing kidney disease.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's low physical activity level, high BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, especially the high frequency of NSAID use, can be harmful to kidney function over time.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to the following factors:

- **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.838 mg/dL and a GFR of 37.52 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function, which is a key indicator of CKD.
- **Proteinuria**: The presence of 1.618 g/day of protein in the urine and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 129.78 mg/g suggests kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.
- **Hypertension**: A systolic blood pressure of 162 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 87 mmHg are above the normal range, and uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
- **Diabetes Indicators**: Although there's no family history of diabetes, the fasting glucose level of 139.877 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.262% indicate poor glucose control, which can contribute to kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, low physical activity (0.482 hours/week), and a high BMI (33.374) are all risk factors for CKD.
- **Medications and Electrolytes**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even at a frequency of 6.655 times/week, can affect kidney function. Electrolyte imbalances, though not severely abnormal, also contribute to the risk.

However, factors such as good sleep quality, relatively good diet quality, and high health literacy somewhat mitigate these risks but are not enough to offset the strong presence of CKD risk factors.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to several key factors:

1. **Kidney Function**: The patient's GFR (37.5 mL/min/1.73 m²) is significantly lower than the normal range (90-120 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. The elevated creatinine level (2.84 mg/dL) further supports this.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of a substantial amount of protein in the urine (1.62 g/day) and a high ACR (129.78 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.

3. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (162 mmHg) is above the normal range, contributing to the risk and progression of CKD.

4. **Diabetes Risk**: Although there's no family history of diabetes, the patient's fasting glucose (139.88 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.26%) levels are elevated, suggesting impaired glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's smoking habit, low physical activity (0.48 hours/week), and high alcohol consumption (12.38 units/week) are all detrimental to kidney health and contribute to the risk score.

6. **Medications and Electrolytes**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, despite their therapeutic benefits, can also impair kidney function over time. The patient's electrolyte levels, although mostly within normal ranges, need to be monitored due to the potential impact of kidney disease on electrolyte balance.

7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score (72.15/100), indicates that the patient is already experiencing significant impacts from their condition.

These factors cumulatively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly adjustments to the current therapeutic regimen to mitigate progression and manage symptoms effectively.",83,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors present in the provided patient profile. The key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD, as AKI can lead to chronic damage and progressive loss of kidney function over time.
3. **Presence of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD, particularly if they involve the kidneys (pyelonephritis).
4. **Elevated Creatinine and Protein in Urine**: The elevated creatinine level (1.76927755244537 mg/dL) and significant proteinuria (3.8674694693648015 g/day) are direct indicators of impaired kidney function.
5. **Fasting Glucose Level**: Although the HbA1c is within a relatively normal range, the fasting glucose level (152.72040602010333 mg/dL) suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can be a risk factor for kidney disease.
6. **Use of ACE Inhibitors and NSAIDs**: While ACE inhibitors are used to protect the kidneys, the concurrent use of NSAIDs (4.648551276947912 times/week) can potentially counteract this protective effect and increase kidney risk due to their nephrotoxic effects.
7. **Suboptimal Diet and Physical Activity**: Although the diet quality is relatively good (8.724096768769565/10), the physical activity level (9.115796012522187 hours/week) and sleep quality (5.543282072509771/10) could be improved. Suboptimal lifestyle factors can contribute to the risk of CKD.
8. **Medication Adherence**: The moderate level of medication adherence (3.083902314355582/10) might affect the management of conditions like hypertension and diabetes, thereby influencing CKD risk.

The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family history is a significant risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Previous AKI and UTIs**: The history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) indicates previous kidney insults, which can predispose to CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Although the HbA1c is not excessively high, the fasting glucose level of 152.72040602010333 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: The creatinine level of 1.76927755244537 mg/dL and GFR of 76.47002698883333 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate some degree of kidney impairment. The protein in urine (3.8674694693648015 g/day) and ACR (130.78444441209456 mg/g) are also elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within or close to the normal range. However, the total cholesterol and triglycerides are high, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and indirectly affect kidney health.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, especially in the context of hypertension and proteinuria. The use of statins is also beneficial for managing the elevated cholesterol levels.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The low BMI and absence of smoking are positive factors. However, the alcohol consumption and relatively low physical activity level could be improved.

Despite some positive health behaviors and the absence of certain risk factors (e.g., smoking, heavy metals exposure), the presence of kidney damage markers (proteinuria, elevated creatinine, and reduced GFR), history of kidney insults (AKI, UTIs), and metabolic risk factors (elevated glucose, high cholesterol) contribute to a significant risk of CKD progression.

The provided data indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to several factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: Having had AKI in the past increases the risk of developing CKD, as AKI can cause permanent damage to kidney tissues.
3. **UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections)**: Recurrent UTIs can lead to kidney damage over time, increasing the risk of CKD.
4. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level is at the higher end of the range, and the BUN level, while within the normal range, combined with other factors, contributes to the risk assessment.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.8674694693648015 g/day) is a significant indicator of kidney damage and a risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 130.78444441209456 mg/g is above the normal range, indicating kidney damage.
7. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Although the HbA1c is within a Near-Normal range, the fasting glucose level is elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD risk.
8. **Hypertension Management**: Despite being on ACE inhibitors, which are beneficial for CKD patients, the presence of hypertension (indicated by a family history and the need for ACE inhibitors) is a risk factor.
9. **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of underlying kidney issues, although these symptoms have a wide range of causes.

However, mitigating factors include:

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease is 73 out of 100, indicating a moderate to high risk. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing hypertension, a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI is a known risk factor for the development of CKD, as AKI can lead to fibrosis and long-term kidney damage.
3. **Presence of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can contribute to kidney damage and are associated with an increased risk of CKD.
4. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 152.72 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Elevated Creatinine and Proteinuria**: A creatinine level of 1.769 mg/dL and significant proteinuria (3.867 g/day) indicate impaired kidney function.
6. **Hemoglobin and Electrolyte Levels**: While within range, the combination of these factors, including slightly elevated phosphorus and low-normal potassium levels, contributes to the overall risk assessment.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the frequency of NSAID use could potentially exacerbate kidney damage. Good health literacy and relatively good medication adherence are positive factors but do not outweigh the mentioned risk factors.

These factors collectively contribute to a moderate to high risk of chronic kidney disease, underscoring the importance of close monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, as well as adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is based on several factors, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health metrics. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **High Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 2.2085474355743484 mg/dL is higher than the normal range (0.5-1.2 mg/dL for women), indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Elevated ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 183.98501121515852 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as it indicates the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is a marker of kidney disease.
3. **Family History and Other Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors such as smoking and high alcohol consumption increases the risk.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and a high alcohol intake are risk factors for kidney disease. The diet quality is relatively low (1.4692302710060634/10), which can negatively affect kidney health.
5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms like nausea/vomiting and muscle cramps could be indicative of kidney issues, although their frequency and severity need to be considered.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time, especially without the protective effects of medications like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which are not being used.

Despite good sleep quality, high socioeconomic status, and a relatively good BMI, the cumulative effect of the mentioned risk factors contributes to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (including smoking cessation and reduction in alcohol intake), and consideration of dietary improvements are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 65/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory tests, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated creatinine levels (2.2085474355743484 mg/dL) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 183.98501121515852 mg/g, indicating potential kidney damage or disease.
* High fasting glucose (117.82989860457636 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.096191215958531%) levels, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* Age (72 years) and Asian ethnicity, which are non-modifiable risk factors for CKD.
* History of smoking and relatively low physical activity (6.167380805749029 hours/week), which can contribute to CKD risk.
* Presence of nausea/vomiting (4.884667698687936 times/week) and muscle cramps (5.498240836384615 times/week), which could be indicative of underlying kidney issues.
* Low medication adherence (3.624547333036711/10) and moderate health literacy (5.916005186601793/10), which may impact the management of potential CKD risk factors.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.

5. **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: Systolic BP (113 mmHg) and diastolic BP (77 mmHg) are within relatively normal ranges, and fasting glucose (117.82989860457636 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.096191215958531%) levels, although not indicating diabetes, are on the higher end, which could impact kidney health over time.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (1.7204149769404276 times/week) could potentially harm kidney function, but there's no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, which is positive.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups (2.5891115798694813/year) and fair medication adherence (3.624547333036711/10) and health literacy (5.916005186601793/10) are important for managing CKD risk.

Rationale – Key risk drivers
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Age
72 y
Older age is the strongest independent predictor of kidney decline.
Sex & Race
Female, Black
Black adults exhibit higher CKD prevalence; being female is protective but age outweighs it.
Renal Function
Creatinine 2.21 mg/dL (high), GFR 99 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal)
The discrepancy suggests early glomerular damage; elevated creatinine alone flags increased risk.
Albuminuria
ACR 184 mg/g
ACR >30 mg/g is a hallmark of kidney injury; values >100 mg/g are associated with rapid progression.
Glucose & Hemoglobin A1c
117 mg/dL fasting glucose, 6.1 % HbA1c
Mild hyperglycemia raises CKD risk, though not overt diabetes.
Blood Pressure
113/77 mmHg
Within normal range; no hypertension burden.
Lifestyle
• Smoker (yes) • NSAIDs 1.7×/week
Both increase risk of nephrotoxicity and renal inflammation.
Diet Quality
1.5/10
Very low; poor protein‑calorie balance and possible high sodium intake can worsen kidney outcomes.
Physical Activity & Sleep
6 h/wk activity, 9.6/10 sleep
These protective behaviors help counterbalance other risks.
Lipid Profile
Total 272, LDL 135, HDL 60
Mildly dyslipidemic; not a major CKD driver but may contribute to vascular injury.
Symptoms
Mild fatigue, occasional muscle cramps
Non‑specific but may hint at early uremic symptoms.
Net Assessment
Positive indicators: Normal BP, good sleep, regular medical check‑ups, low alcohol use.
Negative indicators: Advanced age, significant proteinuria/albuminuria, elevated creatinine, smoking, frequent NSAID use, poor diet.",65.0,Caucasian,Black

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is determined based on several factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: As a 72-year-old individual from a high socioeconomic background, age is a significant risk factor, but socioeconomic status may provide better access to healthcare, mitigating some risks.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. The reported alcohol consumption is within a moderate range but smoking is a significant concern.
3. **Medical History and Clinical Measurements**: The absence of family kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes history is positive. However, the presence of elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggests impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD. The creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney impairment, but the GFR is within the normal range, which might suggest that the kidney function is not severely compromised at this point.
4. **Electrolytes and Renal Function**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but the protein in urine (albuminuria) and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) are elevated, indicating kidney damage.
5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of nausea/vomiting and muscle cramps could be indicative of electrolyte imbalances or renal issues. The quality of life score is relatively low, which may reflect the impact of CKD symptoms or other health issues on daily life.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical check-ups and fair medication adherence are positive factors. However, the health literacy score could be improved, which is crucial for effectively managing CKD.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the calculation of the risk score takes into account both the positive and negative factors, leading to a score of 73/100. This suggests a significant risk for CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring of kidney function, management of risk factors (such as smoking and glucose regulation), and possibly more frequent medical evaluations to prevent or slow the progression of CKD.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 73/100

The provided risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the comprehensive data given, including demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated creatinine levels (4.86982368627336 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (67.97245059105097 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (1.7377646953805614 g/day) and a high ACR (289.7016450749975 mg/g) also suggest kidney damage.

2. **Medical History and Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and diabetes, suggests the presence of these conditions, which are risk factors for CKD. The presence of antidiabetic medications further indicates diabetes management issues, a significant risk factor for CKD.

3. **Symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL)**: Symptoms such as edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching are common in CKD patients. A reduced QoL score (51.56537444187628/100) may reflect the impact of these symptoms on daily life.

4. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: While the diet quality is high (9.59689219114014/10), and physical activity is moderate (7.584085300912829 hours/week), alcohol consumption (11.431778305934383 units/week) and poor sleep quality (4.557684798722238/10) could negatively affect kidney health. The low medication adherence (1.6447074539126127/10) and health literacy (3.410169571407875/10) scores may hinder effective management of CKD risk factors.

5. **Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors**: Being male and of lower socioeconomic status may also contribute to a higher risk of CKD due to potential barriers in accessing healthcare and managing chronic conditions effectively.

Considering these factors, the calculated risk score of 74/100 reflects a significant risk of chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for closer monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and adherence to medical treatments to mitigate this risk.",74,Asian,Black,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg is higher than the ideal range, contributing to an increased risk of CKD. Hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 127.87438094616678 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of developing CKD, especially if it progresses to diabetes.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.9972369560148735 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage or disease. The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 285.88711466996284 mg/g further supports this, as it is close to the upper limit of the range, suggesting kidney damage.
5. **Low GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 74.10156792687074 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal range, is on the lower end, indicating potential early signs of kidney function impairment.
6. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: The use of tobacco (yes to smoking) and high alcohol consumption (19.811899604213135 units/week) are both risk factors for CKD, as they can impair kidney function over time.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (1.5931000454985322 times/week) can affect kidney function, particularly with long-term use or in high doses.

However, mitigating factors include good water quality, no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, a relatively high level of physical activity, and good health literacy. Despite these, the overall profile suggests a need for monitoring and possibly intervention to reduce the risk of progression to more severe CKD. Regular medical check-ups, adherence to medication, lifestyle modifications (such as reducing alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, and dietary adjustments), and close monitoring of kidney function are recommended.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: **67/100**

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key points influencing this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg is significantly elevated, which is a direct risk factor for kidney damage and CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: A level of 127.874 mg/dL indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation, which can be a precursor to diabetes, another major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.997 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
5. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 285.887 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
6. **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: A GFR of 74.101 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal range, is on the lower end, indicating potential early kidney function impairment.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. The reported alcohol intake is near the upper limit of the range, and smoking is a direct risk factor.
8. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can affect kidney function, with NSAIDs potentially being nephrotoxic with frequent use.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as nausea/vomiting and itching may indicate underlying issues that could affect kidney health or be related to kidney dysfunction.

However, factors mitigating the risk include a relatively high level of physical activity, good diet quality, and a high level of health literacy, which could facilitate better health management and adherence to protective behaviors. The risk score of 67/100 reflects a notable risk for CKD, necessitating careful monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly intervention to mitigate risk factors.",67,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg is significantly higher than the normal range, posing a risk to kidney health. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to kidney damage over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 127.874 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for the development of diabetes, another major cause of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.997 g/day of protein in urine is a clear indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
5. **Altered Kidney Function Tests**: A GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) of 74.101 mL/min/1.73 m², although within a relatively normal range, combined with a creatinine level of 1.254 mg/dL and a BUN level of 5.560 mg/dL, suggests some degree of kidney function impairment.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even at a frequency of 1.593 times/week, can have adverse effects on kidney function, especially with long-term use.
7. **Suboptimal Health Behaviors**: Although the individual has a high level of health literacy and relatively good adherence to medication, the frequency of medical check-ups is lower than recommended, which could lead to delayed diagnosis or management of potential health issues.

These factors, combined with the individual's socioeconomic status, lifestyle choices (including smoking and alcohol consumption), and other health indicators, contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease.

Mildly reduced (stage 2), but combined with proteinuria raises risk of progression.
Family history of hypertension
Yes
Genetic predisposition to renal vascular disease.
Lifestyle factors
Smoking present; alcohol near upper limit (19.8 units/week)
Both can worsen renal perfusion and accelerate decline.
Other labs
Fasting glucose 128 mg/dL (pre‑diabetes)
Adds metabolic stress to kidneys.
Protective factors
Normal BMI, high health literacy, regular check‑ups
Mitigate but do not offset the above risks.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and symptoms. The key points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated levels of fasting glucose (158.66998634664856 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.565244312463648%) indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for developing CKD.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 68.81326755903373 mL/min/1.73 m² suggests impaired kidney function. Although it's not severely reduced, it's lower than the normal range, indicating some level of kidney impairment.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.094842238205736 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 155.3460895959623 mg/g are strong indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension**: Although the current blood pressure (119/62 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of family history of hypertension and the other mentioned risk factors suggest a potential for future hypertension, which can exacerbate kidney disease.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The moderate level of physical activity (4.301182736076906 hours/week) and good diet quality (8.248017914341673/10) are positive factors. However, the BMI of 25.380343917108267 indicates overweight status, which can increase the risk of CKD.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, but the presence of symptoms like edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced Quality of Life (QoL) score, indicates some level of kidney dysfunction affecting daily life.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a significant risk of chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially more aggressive management of risk",73,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided information:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure (119 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of family history of hypertension and other metabolic parameters suggests a potential risk for developing hypertension, which could impact kidney health.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (158.66998634664856 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.565244312463648%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, suggesting prediabetes or diabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 68.81326755903373 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range (which is generally considered to be above 90 mL/min/1.73 m² for adults), indicating some level of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.094842238205736 g/day) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it indicates kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some electrolytes and cholesterol levels are within normal ranges, the presence of elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol could contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked with CKD risk.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels but does not directly impact CKD risk. Symptoms like edema, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting could be indicative of underlying kidney issues or other health problems that may influence CKD risk.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: The relatively low physical activity level, moderate alcohol consumption, and variable diet quality could contribute to an increased risk of CKD by affecting blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and overall vascular health.

Given these factors, the calculated risk score reflects a significant concern for the development or progression of CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk factors.",74,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 75/100**

Impact on CKD risk
Evidence in this case
Age 81 yr
Older age = higher baseline risk and faster progression
81 yr, near upper limit of healthy aging
Blood pressure 146/114 mmHg
Hypertension strongly promotes CKD progression
Systolic/diastolic values well above normal; diastolic ≥ 110 mmHg is a red‑flag
Diabetes (FPG 153 mg/dL, HbA1c 9.8 %)
Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia accelerates nephropathy
No antidiabetic medication, high glucose markers
Proteinuria 1.3 g/day & ACR 152 mg/g
Reflects significant glomerular damage
Values above 1 g/day and >100 mg/g are prognostically adverse
GFR 79 mL/min/1.73 m²
Mildly reduced, but combined with proteinuria indicates Stage 2–3 CKD
Below 90 mL/min but above 60; proteinuria magnifies risk
Previous AKI episode
Increases likelihood of chronic decline
History of acute kidney injury noted
BMI 38 kg/m²
Obesity is a CKD risk factor
Class II obesity
Lifestyle
Smoking (yes), alcohol (≈ 5 units/wk), low physical activity (~3 h/wk)
These habits elevate cardiovascular and kidney risk
Medication adherence 1.8/10
Poor adherence weakens BP and lipid control
Low adherence likely undermines therapy effectiveness

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided medical history and lifestyle information. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure:** Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (146/114 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney blood vessels.
3. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels:** Indicative of poorly controlled diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (1.303184236569868 g/day) and High ACR (152.74721446237058 mg/g):** Proteinuria is a sign of kidney damage and a strong predictor of CKD progression.
5. **GFR (79.29674046054548 mL/min/1.73 m²):** Although within the normal range, it's on the lower end, which could indicate early kidney damage, especially in the context of other risk factors.
6. **Lifestyle Factors:** Smoking, high BMI, relatively low physical activity, and poor diet quality all contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
7. **Medications:** The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of conditions like hypertension and proteinuria but also suggests the presence of risk factors for CKD.

However, factors such as good water quality, absence of heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure, good health literacy, and regular medical checkups somewhat mitigate the risk. Despite these, the presence of multiple significant risk factors justifies a high CKD risk score.",73,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100

Category
Findings
Impact on CKD risk
Demographics
81‑year‑old female, Black
Age > 80 and Black ethnicity independently raise CKD progression risk.
Lifestyle & comorbidities
BMI ≈ 38 (obese), smoker, moderate alcohol use, low physical activity
Adverse metabolic profile and smoking accelerate nephron loss.
Blood pressure
146/114 mmHg
Sustained hypertension is the #1 modifiable driver of CKD progression.
Glycemic status
Fasting glucose 153 mg/dL, HbA1c 9.8 %
Untreated diabetes with poor control markedly increases kidney damage risk.
Renal function & markers
eGFR ≈ 79 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD‑stage 2), proteinuria 1.3 g/day, ACR 153 mg/g
Significant proteinuria and albuminuria are strong predictors of progression to advanced CKD.
Electrolytes & volume status
Potassium 5.49 mEq/L (borderline high), on ACEI & diuretic
Elevated K⁺ reflects reduced tubular handling; medication burden may compound risk.
Medications & exposures
ACEI, diuretic, statin; NSAID use ~1×/week
NSAID exposure, even intermittent, can worsen renal perfusion; ACEI beneficial but needs careful monitoring.
Other factors
No edema, moderate fatigue, good sleep, moderate diet quality
Symptoms suggest early decline; diet & sleep quality somewhat protective but not enough to offset other risk.
Combining these high‑risk elements (age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, prior AKI, significant proteinuria, and medication/NSAID exposure) yields a relatively high probability of CKD progression within the next 5–10 years, thus a risk score of 78/100.",78.0,African American,Black

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

1. **Previous AKI**: A history of acute kidney injury (AKI) increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (146/114 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Diabetes Indicators**: High fasting glucose (153.17632174780846 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.811352149164048%) levels suggest poor glucose control, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in urine (1.303184236569868 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (152.74721446237058 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
5. **Medications**: While ACE inhibitors are beneficial for CKD, the use of diuretics and NSAIDs may affect kidney function.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, low physical activity (2.7943517031356313 hours/week), and poor diet quality (2.2675824694441173/10) contribute to the overall risk.
7. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Elevated potassium levels (5.488923695488506 mEq/L) may indicate impaired kidney function.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:

1. **Normal GFR**: A relatively preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79.29674046054548 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggests some kidney function is maintained.
2. **Good Water Quality**: No exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, and good water quality, reduce the risk of kidney damage from environmental factors.
3. **High Health Literacy**: A high health literacy score (9.46344422181672/10) may indicate better understanding and management of the condition.

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), as these conditions are major risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (160/119 mmHg) are significantly higher than the ideal range, indicating hypertension, which is a primary risk factor for CKD.
3. **Blood Glucose Levels**: The fasting glucose level (138.10175611307722 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.830638330678969%) are elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation or diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: Although the GFR (100.83830696758606 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (4.31779172514445 g/day) and an elevated ACR (142.18086104984562 mg/g) indicate kidney damage, which is a direct marker of CKD.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the physical activity level is high, and alcohol consumption is moderate, the diet quality is relatively low (1.7775320361553637/10), which could contribute to the development or progression of CKD.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, but the occasional use of NSAIDs could potentially harm kidney function. The presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate underlying kidney issues or other health problems that could impact kidney health.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Hypertension**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (160/119 mmHg) are significantly higher than the ideal range, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Family History**: A family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (138.10175611307722 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.830638330678969%) are both above normal, indicating impaired glucose regulation and increasing the risk of CKD.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.31779172514445 g/day) and an elevated ACR (142.18086104984562 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Medications**: The use of NSAIDs (5.297739465166471 times/week) can be nephrotoxic and increase the risk of CKD.
6. **Suboptimal Diet Quality**: A diet quality score of 1.7775320361553637/10 may indicate inadequate nutrient intake and high intake of processed foods, which can contribute to CKD risk.
7. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 52 years old and having a high socioeconomic status may have varying effects on health outcomes, but access to healthcare may help in early detection and management.

However, factors such as the absence of previous AKI, UTIs, and a relatively good GFR (100.83830696758606 mL/min/1.73 m²) somewhat mitigate the risk. Regular medical checkups and high medication adherence are positive factors in managing potential CKD risk.

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated glucose levels indicate poor blood sugar control, which can damage kidneys over time and is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage and a direct indicator of CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 74.61 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range, suggesting impaired kidney function.
5. **High Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is elevated, which can contribute to kidney disease progression.
6. **Obesity (BMI 35.435311381727765)**: Being obese increases the risk of CKD through several mechanisms, including the development of diabetes and hypertension.
7. **Suboptimal Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: Lower diet quality and insufficient physical activity can contribute to obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which are risk factors for CKD.
8. **Medication Adherence and Health Literacy**: Lower scores in medication adherence and health literacy may indicate a higher risk due to potential non-adherence to prescribed treatments that could protect kidney function.

However, factors that slightly mitigate this risk include the absence of a family history of kidney disease or hypertension, no previous AKI or UTIs, and good water quality.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The high fasting glucose level (156.9 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.45%) indicate poor glycemic control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **High Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure (106 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure (114 mmHg) is elevated, which can increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.34 g/day) and an elevated ACR (182.37 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage and increase the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 74.61 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal range, is on the lower end, which may indicate some degree of kidney impairment.
6. **Obesity (BMI 35.44)**: Being significantly overweight increases the risk of developing CKD, as it is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders that can affect kidney health.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for blood pressure control and to protect kidney function in patients with diabetes or CKD, suggests that there is an attempt to manage risk factors but also indicates the presence of conditions that require such medications.
8. **Suboptimal Health Behaviors**: The reported physical activity level (2.83 hours/week), diet quality (5.28/10), and sleep quality (7.99/10) could be improved, as these factors play a role in managing and reducing the risk of CKD.
9. **Lipid Profile**: Elevated total cholesterol (253.58 mg/dL) and triglycerides (266.14 mg/dL) can contribute to the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are closely linked to CKD.",73,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 67/100**

3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Fasting glucose is slightly elevated (113.04 mg/dL), and HbA1c is within the normal range (4.60%), suggesting mild glucose metabolism impairment.
4. **Kidney Function**: Creatinine is slightly elevated (1.34 mg/dL), but GFR is within the normal range (99.96 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating relatively preserved kidney function.
5. **Proteinuria**: Protein in urine is mildly elevated (1.28 g/day), and ACR is elevated (195.36 mg/g), indicating some kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Electrolytes are within normal ranges, and lipid profiles are mostly within normal ranges, although triglycerides are slightly elevated (141.80 mg/dL).
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs (6.82 times/week) may contribute to CKD risk, while the absence of edema and relatively low fatigue and nausea/vomiting scores suggest minimal current disease burden.
8. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: A relatively low BMI (19.92), moderate physical activity (9.25 hours/week), and good diet quality (5.24/10) are positive factors, while low health literacy (7.37/10) and infrequent medical checkups (0.41/year) may hinder disease management and prevention.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical parameters, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Age and Demographics**: Being 32 years old and female, with a low socioeconomic status, may contribute to a slightly higher risk due to potential barriers in accessing healthcare services. However, age itself is not a significant risk factor at this stage.

2. **Lifestyle**: A low BMI (19.92) indicates underweight, which can be a risk factor for CKD due to potential malnutrition affecting kidney function. Moderate alcohol consumption (8.03 units/week) and a relatively high level of physical activity (9.25 hours/week) are generally positive for health. Diet quality (5.24/10) and sleep quality (6.69/10) are average and could be improved to reduce the risk of CKD.

3. **Medical History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk. The absence of previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) and UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) also lowers the risk.

4. **Clinical Parameters**: Blood pressure (96/100 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, although the diastolic is slightly elevated. Fasting glucose (113.04 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, indicating impaired fasting glucose, which is a risk factor for diabetes and potentially CKD. HbA1c (4.60%) is within the normal range. Creatinine (1.34 mg/dL) and BUN (21.87 mg/dL) levels are slightly elevated but not significantly high. The GFR (99.96 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, indicating good kidney function. Protein in urine (1.28 g/day) and ACR (195.36 mg/g) are slightly elevated, indicating some kidney stress or early damage.

5. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Electrolyte and lipid profiles are largely within normal ranges, with some minor deviations (e.g., slightly high sodium and low potassium), but these are not significantly contributing to the CKD risk at this level.

6. **Medications**: The use of NSAIDs (6.82 times/week) could",23,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 45/100
Rationale (key points)
Proteinuria & ACR – 1.3 g/day of protein and an ACR of 195 mg/g fall into the micro‑albuminuria range, a strong early marker for CKD progression.
Normal eGFR but elevated creatinine – eGFR ≈100 mL/min/1.73 m² is preserved, yet a creatinine of 1.34 mg/dL suggests a modest reduction in filtration that may worsen over time.
High NSAID use – 6.8 times per week is associated with nephrotoxicity and acute kidney injury risk, potentially accelerating chronic damage.
Anemia (Hb ≈ 10 g/dL) – often accompanies early CKD and indicates some degree of renal insufficiency.
Blood pressure – systolic/diastolic 96/100 mmHg is within normal limits for systolic but the diastolic elevation (≥100 mmHg) can signal early vascular stiffness; not a major driver yet but worth monitoring.
Lifestyle & demographics – 32‑year‑old Black female with low socioeconomic status; race adds a modest baseline risk, while BMI (≈19.9) and absence of smoking mitigate it.
Other lab trends – mild hyperphosphatemia (4.49 mg/dL) and slightly high calcium (10.15 mg/dL) hint at early mineral‑bone disorder, a CKD complication.
Taken together, the profile reflects early kidney injury with several modifiable risk factors, yielding a moderate estimated 10‑year CKD risk of 45 %.",45.0,African American,Black

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively moderate, considering various factors from the provided medical history, lifestyle, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of family kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Clinical Parameters**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are within a relatively normal range, but the fasting glucose level is slightly elevated, which could indicate a predisposition to diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the GFR is within the normal range, which suggests that kidney function is currently not severely impaired but warrants monitoring.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in urine (proteinuria) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) are significant risk factors for CKD, indicating potential kidney damage.
5. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but the hemoglobin level is slightly below the normal range, which could indicate anemia, a common complication in CKD patients.
6. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: High physical activity and good sleep quality are positive factors. However, the diet quality could be improved, and alcohol consumption, although moderate, should be monitored.
7. **Medications**: The use of statins is beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk, a common comorbidity with CKD, but the frequent use of NSAIDs could potentially harm kidney function over time.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, suggests some impact on daily living that could be related to underlying health issues, including potential early signs of CKD.

The risk score of 34/100 suggests a moderate risk for CKD, emphasizing the need for regular medical check-ups, adherence to medication, improvement in diet quality, careful monitoring of kidney function tests, and management of potential risk factors such as blood glucose levels and blood pressure to prevent the progression of kidney disease.",34,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 58/100
Rationale
Proteinuria & ACR – 1.27 g/day and an ACR of 195 mg/g are above normal limits and signal early kidney damage, a strong predictor of CKD progression.
Blood pressure – Diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg (with a systolic of 96) is atypical but suggests a hypertensive component that can accelerate renal injury.
NSAID exposure – Usage of NSAIDs ~6.8 × week is high and known to impair renal perfusion, especially when combined with proteinuria.
GFR and creatinine – GFR remains near normal (≈100 mL/min/1.73 m²) but creatinine is on the higher end; together with anemia (Hb ≈ 10 g/dL) this hints at early functional changes.
Metabolic profile – Fasting glucose is mildly elevated (113 mg/dL) and, while A1c is normal, pre‑diabetic values increase long‑term CKD risk.
Lifestyle & demographics – Good BMI, moderate alcohol and activity levels, and absence of smoking or familial CKD reduce risk, but socioeconomic and educational factors may limit access to preventive care.
Balancing the protective lifestyle factors against the significant proteinuria, diastolic hypertension, and NSAID exposure yields a moderate‑high risk estimate of 58 % for developing clinically significant chronic kidney disease over the next decade.",58.0,African American,Hispanic

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD by causing repeated damage to the kidneys.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The high fasting glucose ( mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.05%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR  mg/g)**: The presence of protein in the urine, as indicated by the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Use of ACE Inhibitors**: While ACE inhibitors are used to protect the kidneys, their use in this context may also indicate the presence of conditions like hypertension or proteinuria that necessitate their use, indirectly pointing to kidney issues.
6. **Suboptimal Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The low diet quality (/10) and limited physical activity (7 hours/week) can contribute to various health issues, including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, although not specific to CKD, can be associated with kidney dysfunction and contribute to the overall risk assessment.

However, factors such as the relatively preserved GFR (92.03 mL/min/1.73 m²), good water quality, absence of heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure, and high socioeconomic status somewhat mitigate the risk. Nonetheless, the combination of genetic predisposition, metabolic factors, and lifestyle issues places this individual at a significant risk for CKD.

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease, especially when combined with elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level of 146.49 mg/dL and HbA1c of 9.0536% indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for kidney disease.
3. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range (119 mmHg), the diastolic BP is on the higher side (97 mmHg), and the use of ACE inhibitors suggests hypertension management is necessary, which is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The GFR of 92.03 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in urine (0.3673514610210454 g/day) and an elevated ACR (202.38378794756275 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The relatively low physical activity level (0.652699924503275 hours/week), poor diet quality (0.1759248799391488/10), and moderate alcohol consumption (13.689502037569554 units/week) contribute to the overall risk.
6. **Previous UTIs**: A history of UTIs can increase the risk of kidney disease, especially if not properly managed.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic blood pressure (119 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure (97 mmHg) is slightly elevated, indicating potential hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (146.49 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.05%) are elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation or diabetes, both of which are strong risk factors for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: The estimated GFR (92.03 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (0.367 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (202.38 mg/g) indicates kidney damage or disease.
5. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for conditions like hypertension and diabetes, may also indicate a higher risk of CKD, especially if used to manage conditions that are risk factors for CKD.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a relatively low QoL score (74.33/100), may reflect underlying health issues, including potential CKD.
7. **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups (2.44/year) and medication adherence (1.46/10) could be improved, which might impact the management and progression of CKD risk factors.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors. Main points include:
- **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
- **Previous UTIs**: The history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of developing CKD, especially if the infections are recurrent or severe.
- **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (107 mmHg), the diastolic blood pressure is somewhat elevated (115 mmHg), which may indicate potential vascular issues that could impact kidney health over time.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (102.5658261905383 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.243699835094443%) are slightly elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
- **Kidney Function (GFR)**: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 77.9689953570467 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates slightly reduced kidney function, although it is still within the normal range for many adults. Reduced GFR is a key indicator of CKD.
- **Electrolytes and Minerals**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within normal ranges, which is positive. However, slightly elevated potassium levels (5.072592112226279 mEq/L) could be a concern over time.
- **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 26.166477825123525 mg/g is slightly elevated, indicating some degree of kidney damage or disease, as protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The high BMI (30.155056340258295), indicating obesity, is a significant risk factor for CKD. Moderate alcohol consumption (18.08753667321985 units/week) and the use of NSAIDs (1.406722230591424 times/week) could also contribute to kidney strain.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score include:

- **Family history of hypertension**: Increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- **Previous UTIs**: May indicate potential kidney damage or increased susceptibility to kidney problems.
- **Systolic and diastolic blood pressure**: Although within a relatively normal range, the diastolic pressure is on the higher end, which can be a risk factor for CKD.
- **Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels**: slightly elevated, indicating potential pre-diabetic states, which are risk factors for CKD.
- **Protein in urine (ACR)**: Elevated, suggesting kidney damage or disease.
- **Electrolyte and lipid profiles**: Some parameters are near the upper limits of normal ranges, which could indicate metabolic issues that might affect kidney health.
- **Medications and lifestyle**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can increase the risk of kidney problems. The BMI and alcohol consumption are also risk factors.
- **Symptoms & QoL**: Fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting quality of life.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **No family history of kidney disease or diabetes**.
- **Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals**.
- **High diet quality and reasonable physical activity level**.
- **No current use of medications known to negatively impact kidney function, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics, without a clear medical reason**.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the absence of severe indicators (e.g., significantly impaired GFR, high levels of proteinuria, or a history of AKI) and the presence of protective factors result in a moderate risk score. Monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with maintaining a healthy lifestyle, are crucial to prevent the progression of kidney disease.",43,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 45/100
Brief Rationale
eGFR & Albuminuria – Your eGFR (~78 mL/min/1.73 m²) is in the mildly reduced range, and the ACR of 26 mg/g indicates early micro‑albuminuria, which is a key predictor of CKD progression.
Blood Pressure – Systolic BP is normal (107 mmHg), but diastolic BP is elevated (115 mmHg), contributing to ongoing renal stress.
Metabolic Factors – A BMI of 30.2 classifies you as obese, and while HbA1c and fasting glucose are near‑normal, the borderline fasting glucose (≈103 mg/dL) and high triglycerides (≈99 mg/dL) reflect a metabolic profile that can worsen kidney outcomes.
Lifestyle & Medications – NSAID use ~1.4 times/week and a moderate alcohol intake (18 units/week) add nephrotoxic risk.
Family & Personal History – Positive family history of hypertension and a history of UTIs further raise risk, especially with current micro‑albuminuria.
Protective Factors – No smoking, good diet quality, and adequate sleep lower the risk somewhat.
Overall, the combination of early renal changes, hypertension, obesity, and NSAID exposure places you in a moderate risk category for CKD progression, hence the score of 45/100. Regular monitoring, BP control, weight management, and minimizing NSAIDs are recommended to mitigate this risk.",45.0,Caucasian,Asian

2. **Proteinuria:** The presence of protein in the urine (0.2667351696249237 g/day) and an elevated Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 148.84701734836807 mg/g are markers of kidney damage, which is a risk factor for CKD progression.

3. **Blood Pressure:** While the systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within a relatively controlled range (129/76 mmHg), they are on the higher end of what is considered ideal for protecting kidney health, which could contribute to CKD progression if not managed properly.

4. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors:** A diet quality of 8.691741420473429/10 is good, but the sleep quality is relatively poor (4.729713918179458/10), which can impact overall health, including kidney health. The moderate level of physical activity and absence of smoking are positive factors.

5. **Exposures:** The presence of occupational chemical exposure and poor water quality can be additional risk factors for CKD, as certain chemicals and contaminants can be harmful to kidney function.

6. **Medical History and Current Health:** The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk. However, the presence of symptoms like frequent nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a lower quality of life score, indicates current health issues that could be related to CKD or other underlying conditions affecting kidney health.

Considering these factors, the calculated risk score reflects a heightened concern for CKD due to the compromised kidney function, presence of proteinuria, and other lifestyle and environmental factors, balanced against the absence of certain significant risk factors like a family history of related diseases and the generally good diet quality. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, proteinuria, and adherence to healthy lifestyle choices are crucial to prevent progression of CKD.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

2. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in urine (0.2667 g/day) and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 148.85 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
3. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's current health status, including slightly elevated blood pressure (129/76 mmHg) and borderline HbA1c (6.26%), needs monitoring.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's alcohol consumption (18.7 units/week) is close to the upper limit, and physical activity (3.2 hours/week) is somewhat low, which may impact kidney health.
5. **Occupational Chemical Exposure and Poor Water Quality**: These environmental factors may increase the risk of kidney damage.
6. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, although not severe, are symptoms that can be associated with CKD.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on multiple factors from your provided data. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk assessment:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: As a 69-year-old male from a middle socioeconomic background, your age places you in a higher risk category for CKD, but your socioeconomic status may provide access to better healthcare, potentially mitigating some risks.

2. **Lifestyle Factors**: Your BMI is within a relatively healthy range, which is positive. However, your alcohol consumption (18.71 units/week) is high and may contribute to health issues, including kidney problems. Your physical activity levels are moderate, and diet quality is good, which are protective factors. Sleep quality is average, which might not significantly impact CKD risk directly but can influence overall health.

3. **Medical History and Family History**: The absence of family histories of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces your genetic predisposition to CKD. Not having previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) or UTIs also lowers your risk.

4. **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: Your blood pressure (129/76 mmHg) is slightly elevated, which is a risk factor for CKD. However, your fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, suggesting good glucose control.

5. **Kidney Function Tests**: Your creatinine level is slightly elevated (1.48 mg/dL), and your GFR (42.15 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicates impaired kidney function, placing you at a significant risk for CKD. Protein in urine (0.27 g/day) and ACR (148.85 mg/g) are also elevated, indicating kidney damage.

6. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: Your electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, which is good. However, your lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, which can increase cardiovascular risk and indirectly affect kidney health.

7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency (1.38 times/week), can be harmful to kidney function over time. Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, suggest some level of discomfort or health issue that might be related to kidney function",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 72/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD, as it can lead to permanent damage and scarring of the kidneys.

2. **Elevated Blood Pressure:** The systolic blood pressure of 172 mmHg is higher than the recommended range, which increases the risk of kidney damage over time. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.

3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria):** The presence of 3.61646061921223 g/day of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass through into the urine. The high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 93.86370634374816 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage.

4. **Reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** A GFR of 62.839746238426706 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function. Although it is not severely reduced, it is on the lower end of the normal range and, combined with other factors, contributes to the elevated risk.

5. **Medications and Substances:** The use of NSAIDs 7.408150419188977 times/week may further increase the risk of kidney damage, as these drugs can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and worsen kidney function over time.

6. **Poor Water Quality:** Exposure to poor water quality could potentially increase the risk of CKD due to unknown contaminants that might have adverse effects on kidney health.

7. **Family History and Other Health Factors:** While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the combination of other factors still places this individual at a significant risk for CKD.

Despite a relatively healthy lifestyle, including a good diet quality, adequate sleep, and high physical activity levels, the presence of specific health issues and risk factors contributes to an elevated risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring of kidney function and management of hypertension, along with careful consideration of medication use and environmental exposures, are crucial to mitigating this risk.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and exposures. The key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure:** High systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (172/100 mmHg) are significant risk factors for CKD, as hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio):** The presence of protein in the urine (3.61646061921223 g/day) and an elevated ACR (93.86370634374816 mg/g) indicate kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate):** A GFR of 62.839746238426706 mL/min/1.73 m² is lower than the normal range (90-120 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **Medications and Substances:** The use of NSAIDs (7.408150419188977 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with frequent use.
6. **Lifestyle Factors:** While the BMI (19.87772050060525) and diet quality (7.241699080747759/10) are within favorable ranges, the high alcohol consumption (18.96618760860733 units/week) could negatively impact kidney health.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life:** The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, along with a poor quality of life score (2.931547215311203/100), may reflect the impact of kidney dysfunction on overall health.

Despite favorable factors such as no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and good health literacy and medication adherence, the aforementioned risk factors contribute to a significant risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and potentially pharmacological interventions are recommended to manage and mitigate the progression of CKD.",74,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Age and Gender**: At 75 years old, age is a significant risk factor for CKD. Being female also has an impact, although generally, males are at higher risk.

2. **Medical History**: A history of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) significantly increases the risk of developing CKD. The absence of family histories of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes slightly mitigates this risk but is overshadowed by the AKI history.

3. **Clinical Measurements**: 
   - Elevated blood pressure (172/100 mmHg) is a major risk factor for CKD.
   - The fasting glucose level is within the normal range, but the HbA1c level, although below the diabetic threshold, suggests good glucose control.
   - The creatinine level is slightly elevated (1.352 mg/dL), indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
   - The GFR (62.839 mL/min/1.73 m²) is below the normal range (>90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
   - Protein in urine (3.616 g/day) and ACR (93.863 mg/g) are elevated, indicating kidney damage.

4. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**:
   - High alcohol consumption (18.966 units/week) can be harmful to kidney health.
   - Physical activity (5.564 hours/week) is moderate, which is beneficial.
   - Diet quality (7.241/10) is relatively good, which can help manage CKD risk factors.
   - Sleep quality (7.672/10) is good, which is beneficial for overall health.

5. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - The use of NSAIDs (7.408 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
   - The presence of statins in the medication regimen is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels but does not directly impact CKD risk.
   - Poor water quality could potentially expose individuals to harmful substances, affecting kidney health.

The risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Previous UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD by causing damage to the kidneys over time.
3. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure (176/67 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to function properly.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.5593164246944364 g/day) indicates kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 103.82192753244172 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
6. **Electrolyte and Mineral Imbalances**: Although within ranges, the levels of certain electrolytes and minerals (e.g., potassium, phosphorus) need to be carefully managed in the context of kidney function.
7. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be harmful to kidney function and may exacerbate CKD.
8. **Exposure to Heavy Metals**: Exposure to heavy metals can be nephrotoxic and contribute to kidney damage.
9. **Poor Water Quality**: Consuming water of poor quality can expose individuals to various toxins and heavy metals, potentially harming kidney health.

However, factors that slightly mitigate the risk include:
- **No Family History of Kidney Disease or Diabetes**: The absence of these in the family history slightly reduces the risk.
- **Good Sleep Quality and Diet Quality**: High scores in sleep and diet quality are beneficial for overall health and may help counterbalance some risk factors.
- **No Smoking**: Not smoking reduces the risk of many health issues, including CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high, mainly due to several key factors:
1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor, as hypertension is a major cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (176 mmHg) is elevated, which is a primary risk factor for developing CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 1.5593164246944364 g/day of protein in the urine is indicative of kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.
4. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 103.82192753244172 mg/g suggests kidney damage, further increasing the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Previous UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can contribute to kidney damage over time.
6. **Exposure to Heavy Metals**: Exposure to heavy metals is known to be nephrotoxic and can contribute to kidney damage and CKD.
7. **Poor Water Quality**: This could potentially expose the individual to additional toxins that may affect kidney health.

However, factors mitigating this risk to some extent include:
- **No Previous AKI**: The absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI) reduces the risk of CKD.
- **Good Sleep Quality and Diet Quality**: These lifestyle factors contribute positively to overall health and may help mitigate some risk factors for CKD.
- **No Smoking**: Not smoking reduces the risk of many health issues, including CKD.

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data shared, which includes demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and exposure to certain risk factors. The key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as hypertension can damage kidney function over time.
2. **High Systolic Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 176 mmHg is higher than the recommended levels, indicating hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 1.5593164246944364 g/day of protein in the urine and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 103.82192753244172 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys should filter waste while keeping protein in the bloodstream.
4. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections can increase the risk of developing CKD, possibly due to the inflammatory response and potential kidney damage associated with these infections.
5. **Exposure to Heavy Metals**: Exposure to heavy metals is known to be nephrotoxic and can cause kidney damage, contributing to the risk of CKD.
6. **Poor Water Quality**: Consuming water of poor quality may expose individuals to various contaminants that could negatively affect kidney health.
7. **High BMI**: A BMI of 34.84739137986292 indicates obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD, partly due to the higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in obese individuals.
8. **Medication Use (NSAIDs)**: Frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be harmful to kidney function and increase the risk of CKD.
9. **Less Frequent Medical Checkups and Medium Health Literacy**: Infrequent medical checkups (0.6743665531744183 times/year) and a health literacy score of 5.090732596147579/10 may indicate a reduced ability to manage health effectively, potentially contributing to the progression of risk factors for CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 176 mmHg is significantly high, which is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 1.5593164246944364 g/day of protein in the urine is indicative of kidney damage. Proteinuria is a marker of kidney dysfunction and increases the risk of CKD progression.
4. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 103.82192753244172 mg/g suggests significant proteinuria, further indicating kidney damage.
5. **Previous UTIs**: Yes to UTIs, which can increase the risk of CKD if they lead to kidney damage or if they are a symptom of an underlying condition affecting the kidneys.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality and sleep quality are relatively good, and there is no smoking, the high BMI (34.84739137986292) is a risk factor for developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are linked to CKD.
7. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (5.999446347982857 times/week) can be harmful to the kidneys, especially with long-term or high-dose use. Exposure to heavy metals and poor water quality are also risk factors for CKD.
8. **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups is low (0.6743665531744183 times/year), which might delay the early detection and management of CKD risk factors.

Despite some protective factors such as no family history of kidney disease, no previous AKI, good diet quality, and high sleep quality, the cumulative effect of the risk factors listed above contributes to an elevated risk score for CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is high, primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous UTIs is a relevant factor. UTIs can increase the risk of kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (114/70 mmHg, with a diastolic slightly elevated at 107 mmHg) do not significantly contribute to a high risk, but blood pressure management is crucial for kidney health.
3. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (118.5472339752838 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.363630756727414%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for developing kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (0.8240569630668613 mg/dL) and GFR (65.28254197916881 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function. The GFR value is below the normal range, indicating kidney disease.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: High levels of protein in urine (4.906839874054148 g/day) and an elevated ACR (131.9348515472113 mg/g) are strong indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but the hemoglobin level (10.201530514175293 g/dL) is slightly low, which could indicate anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are risk factors. The diet quality is good, but physical activity is low, which can negatively impact overall health and kidney function.
8. **Medications and Adherence**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but NSAIDs use, even at a moderate frequency, can be harmful to the kidneys.

Overall, the combination of impaired kidney function, poor glucose control, proteinuria, and lifestyle factors contributes to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease.",83,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 82/100

2. **Blood Pressure**: The diastolic blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can contribute to kidney strain.
3. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest diabetes or prediabetes, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: The GFR is somewhat decreased, and there is a significant amount of protein in the urine (as indicated by ACR and proteinuria), which are direct indicators of kidney dysfunction.
5. **Lifestyle and Other Factors**: Smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and a relatively low level of physical activity also contribute to the risk.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors (which can affect kidney function) and the presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching further support the indication of kidney issues.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Poor water quality and lower health literacy are additional risk factors.

Considering these factors, the overall risk of chronic kidney disease is high, warranting close monitoring and possibly a more aggressive management plan to prevent progression.",83,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:
1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, which slightly reduces the risk, but there's no family history of hypertension or diabetes either, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
2. **Medical History**: History of UTIs, which can be a risk factor for CKD if not properly managed.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, but the diastolic BP is slightly elevated, which can indicate some level of risk.
4. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest diabetes or prediabetes, a significant risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR is somewhat decreased, indicating some level of kidney impairment. The creatinine and BUN levels are within ranges that could indicate early stages of kidney dysfunction.
6. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: High levels of protein in the urine and an elevated ACR are strong indicators of kidney damage, significantly increasing the risk of CKD.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption can exacerbate kidney problems. While the BMI is within a healthy range, and sleep quality is good, the diet quality could be improved, and physical activity is relatively low.
8. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors can be protective for kidney function, especially in the context of diabetes or hypertension, but the frequent use of NSAIDs could potentially harm kidney function.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a noticeable impact on quality of life, suggests that kidney function may be significantly compromised.
10. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Poor water quality could expose the individual to harmful substances, potentially affecting kidney health. Regular medical checkups and good medication adherence are positive factors, but health literacy could be improved to better manage health conditions.

Considering these factors, the individual has a combination of risk factors (e.g., diabetes indicators, kidney function impairment, lifestyle factors) and some protective factors (e.g., use of ACE inhibitors, regular medical checkups), leading to a moderate to high risk score for chronic kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 78 / 100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health indicators. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous UTIs is a risk factor for CKD.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's lifestyle, including smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, along with relatively low physical activity and fair diet quality, contributes to the risk.
3. **Blood Pressure and Blood Glucose Control**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, along with high fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, indicate poor blood pressure and glucose control, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient's creatinine level, BUN level, and particularly the GFR (65.28 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (4.9068 g/day) and a high ACR (131.93 mg/g) are also indicative of kidney damage.
5. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The patient's electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, but the hemoglobin level is on the lower side, which could be indicative of anemia, a common complication in CKD.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate QoL score, suggests the patient is experiencing some level of discomfort that could be related to CKD.
7. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Poor water quality and moderate health literacy, along with fewer medical checkups, could contribute to a higher risk due to potential environmental exposures and less optimal health management.

These factors collectively contribute to a risk score of 74/100, indicating a significant risk for chronic kidney disease. Management of blood pressure, glucose control, lifestyle modifications, and close monitoring of kidney function are crucial to mitigate this risk.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale (Key Risk Drivers)
Factor
Value
Why it raises CKD risk
Age
89 yrs
Age ≥ 65 is a strong predictor of CKD progression.
Proteinuria
4.91 g/day
> 4 g/day indicates advanced glomerular damage; strongly associated with faster GFR decline.
Albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (ACR)
132 mg/g
> 300 mg/g is severe, 30–300 mg/g is moderate; your value is in the moderate‑to‑severe range.
Diastolic blood pressure
107 mmHg
Elevated diastolic BP can accelerate renal damage, especially with a normal systolic value.
Diabetes control
HbA1c 9.36 %
Poor glycemic control accelerates micro‑ and macro‑vascular complications, including CKD.
Medication use
Frequent NSAID use (3.5 × / wk)
NSAIDs impair renal perfusion and can worsen existing kidney injury.
Anemia
Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL
Reflects chronic kidney dysfunction and can worsen outcomes.
Lifestyle factors
Smoking, moderate alcohol, poor water quality
Contribute to vascular and renal insult.
Lipid profile
LDL 142 mg/dL, triglycerides 327 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia may exacerbate atherosclerotic renal artery disease.
Overall AssessmentYour kidney function is already reduced (eGFR 65 mL/min/1.73 m²) and the presence of high‑grade proteinuria, uncontrolled diabetes, and recurrent NSAID exposure places you at a high risk for rapid CKD progression. The calculated score of 78/100 reflects the convergence of multiple adverse factors, even though some protective elements (normal BMI, good sleep quality, regular medical check‑ups) provide a modest buffer.
Next steps
Tighten glycemic control (target HbA1c < 7 % if tolerated).
Reassess NSAID necessity; consider safer pain alternatives.
Optimize blood‑pressure control (focus on diastolic reduction).
Evaluate for possible referral to a nephrologist for intensified monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions.",78.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 74 out of 100. This high score is based on several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as high blood pressure is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (154 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.7286089763166426 g/day of protein in the urine is abnormal and indicates kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
4. **Low GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 23.29607837171881 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly lower than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **High Fasting Glucose**: The fasting glucose level of 153.3664097481859 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to the development of CKD.
6. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Both smoking (18.48163868181527 units/week of alcohol and yes to smoking) are harmful to kidney health and can accelerate kidney damage.
7. **Physical Activity and Diet Quality**: The relatively low physical activity (5.095132702908365 hours/week) and poor diet quality (2.8856627922002644/10) can contribute to the risk of CKD by exacerbating factors like hypertension and diabetes.

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic BP of 154 mmHg is considered high and is a significant risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidney blood vessels.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose of 153.3664097481859 mg/dL indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for diabetes, a leading cause of CKD.
4. **Low GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 23.29607837171881 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly lower than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.7286089763166426 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, high alcohol consumption (18.48163868181527 units/week), and poor diet quality (2.8856627922002644/10) all contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
7. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (2.796711453684946 times/week) and occupational chemical exposure may further increase the risk of kidney damage.

However, the high quality of sleep (8.856871504733009/10), relatively good water quality, and adherence to medication (4.630184808140909/10) are positive factors that may mitigate some of the risk. Overall, the combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and existing health conditions contributes to a significant risk of CKD.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 82/100
Rationale – key points driving a high CKD risk
Category
What the data shows
Why it raises risk
Renal function
GFR ≈ 23 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD stage 3b)
Very low filtration → advanced disease and higher likelihood of progression
Proteinuria / ACR
3.7 g/day protein; ACR ≈ 185 mg/g
Heavy albuminuria strongly predicts faster decline and cardiovascular complications
Blood pressure
154/82 mmHg
Uncontrolled hypertension is a primary driver of kidney damage and accelerates CKD
Metabolic status
Fasting glucose 153 mg/dL (hyperglycaemia); HbA1c 4.7 % (borderline)
Even transient hyperglycaemia can worsen renal injury, especially with other risk factors
Lifestyle
BMI 38.3 (obese), smoking, alcohol 18 units/week, NSAIDs 3×/week
Obesity, tobacco and NSAID use all increase glomerular pressure and inflammation
Medication / therapy gaps
No ACE/ARB or diuretic; only statin
Missing renoprotective agents (e.g., ACEi/ARB) elevates progression risk
Other risk markers
High triglycerides, moderate HDL, elevated cholesterol
Dyslipidaemia contributes to atherosclerosis, which can impair renal perfusion
Health behaviours
Moderate check‑ups, low medication adherence (4.6/10), low health literacy (2.6/10)
Poor engagement with care can delay interventions that slow CKD progression
The combination of advanced kidney damage (low GFR + heavy proteinuria) with modifiable risk factors (hypertension, obesity, smoking, NSAID use) places this patient in a high‑risk category for rapid CKD progression and cardiovascular events. Hence, a risk score of 82/100 reflects a significant but not maximal risk, indicating urgent need for nephrology referral, tighter BP & glucose control, initiation of ACEi/ARB if not contraindicated, and lifestyle modification.",82.0,Caucasian,Asian

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

- **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
- **High Blood Pressure (154/82 mmHg)**: Elevated systolic blood pressure is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney vessels over time.
- **Low GFR (23.29607837171881 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: A reduced glomerular filtration rate indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
- **Protein in Urine (3.7286089763166426 g/day) and High ACR (185.49164890892737 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a key indicator of kidney damage, and the presence of a high amount of protein in the urine, along with an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), signifies kidney disease.
- **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Both are risk factors for CKD, as they can impair kidney function over time.
- **Poor Diet Quality (2.8856627922002644/10)**: A diet low in quality may contribute to various risk factors for CKD, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
- **High BMI (38.33062653297821)**: Obesity is a risk factor for CKD, partly due to its association with hypertension and diabetes.

Despite good sleep quality and a relatively high quality of life score, the cumulative effect of these risk factors significantly elevates the risk of CKD. Medication adherence is good, but the use of NSAIDs, although not frequent, needs monitoring due to their potential nephrotoxic effects. Statin use is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels but does not directly mitigate CKD risk. Regular medical checkups and addressing modifiable risk factors are crucial to managing and potentially reducing the risk of CKD progression.",83,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

4. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of conditions like hypertension or proteinuria, which are risk factors for CKD. However, good medication adherence and regular medical checkups mitigate some risk.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (31.19) and relatively low diet quality (1.64/10) contribute to the risk, as obesity and poor diet can exacerbate kidney disease. However, the absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and regular physical activity (9.42 hours/week) are positive factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History**: Presence of family kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Renal Function**: Elevated creatinine levels (3.435122321289813 mg/dL) and protein in urine (0.1549432912533987 g/day) with an ACR of 134.73784362570802 mg/g suggest impaired kidney function.
3. **Hypertension Risk**: Although current blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (125/87 mmHg), the use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics indicates management of hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Diabetes Risk**: The presence of antidiabetic medications and a family history of diabetes, despite normal fasting glucose (90.06855386129604 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.476786670309352%) levels, suggests a potential risk factor for CKD.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: High BMI (31.19555762061089), moderate alcohol consumption (0.6808901240052934 units/week), and relatively low diet quality (1.64292567526515/10) contribute to the risk score.
6. **Biochemical Markers**: Elevated total cholesterol (214.49111957922295 mg/dL) and triglycerides (318.1194502748187 mg/dL) may indicate metabolic syndrome, further increasing CKD risk.

These factors outweigh the protective effects of good sleep quality, regular physical activity, and adherence to medical check-ups and medication, resulting in a significant risk score for chronic kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 58/100
Rationale

Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
GFR & Urine
eGFR = 95 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal) but ACR = 135 mg/g (micro‑albuminuria) and proteinuria = 0.15 g/day
Micro‑albuminuria is a strong early marker of CKD progression, offsetting a normal eGFR.
Blood Pressure
Systolic 125 mmHg, Diastolic 87 mmHg
Slightly elevated diastolic; borderline hypertension contributes to renal stress.
Diabetes & Lipids
HbA1c 5.48 % (normal), fasting glucose ~90 mg/dL
No overt diabetes yet, but a family history of diabetes increases susceptibility. Triglycerides 318 mg/dL and HDL 38 mg/dL indicate dyslipidemia, a cardiovascular and renal risk factor.
Body Mass Index
BMI 31  (obese)
Obesity is associated with hyperfiltration and eventual glomerular damage.
Medications & Exposures
On ACE inhibitor and diuretic (beneficial for kidney protection), NSAIDs 0.7 ×/wk (small risk), no statins
ACE inhibition helps preserve renal function, but NSAID use can transiently worsen renal perfusion.
Lifestyle & Health Behaviors
9.4 h physical activity/week (good), diet quality 1.6/10 (poor), alcohol 0.68 units/wk (low), 3.98/10 medication adherence
Poor diet may contribute to metabolic stress; high physical activity and good sleep mitigate some risk.
Family & Past History
Family kidney disease present, no prior AKI or UTIs
Strong familial predisposition raises baseline risk.
Overall Assessment
While the current eGFR is within the normal range, the presence of micro‑albuminuria (ACR 135 mg/g), obesity, poor diet, and a family history of kidney disease suggests a moderate risk of progression toward chronic kidney disease. The score of 58/100 reflects these combined factors, indicating that proactive monitoring (regular urine ACR, BP control, dietary counseling) and lifestyle modifications are advisable to reduce progression risk.",58.0,Caucasian,Black

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data given, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. The key factors contributing to this score are:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease and Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease and diabetes significantly increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Elevated Creatinine and ACR Levels**: The creatinine level is at the higher end of the normal range, and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage or early signs of kidney disease.
3. **Hypertension Management**: Although the current blood pressure is within a relatively safe range, the use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests that hypertension is being managed, which is a common cause of CKD.
4. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The diet quality score is low, and while physical activity is high, the overall lifestyle does not seem to significantly mitigate the risk factors.
5. **Medications and Kidney Health**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can pose a risk to kidney health over time, especially with existing kidney issues.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of muscle cramps and itching, which can be indicative of electrolyte imbalances or kidney issues, along with a moderate quality of life score, suggests some impact on kidney health.

Despite the high level of health literacy and adherence to medication, the combination of genetic predisposition, indicators of potential kidney damage, and managed hypertension contribute to an increased risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular-monitoring and adherence to the current treatment plan, along with lifestyle adjustments to improve diet quality and further reduce risk factors, are crucial.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 72/100

Factor
Impact on CKD risk
Evidence in your profile
Age (23 y)
Low baseline risk
Younger patients normally have lower CKD incidence.
Family history of kidney disease
Strong risk multiplier
Increases likelihood of genetic or early‑onset kidney disorders.
Serum creatinine 3.44 mg/dL
Very high
Suggests significant kidney dysfunction; yet eGFR is quoted as 95 mL/min/1.73 m² – a discrepancy that signals possible measurement or calculation error.
Urine ACR 135 mg/g
Elevated
ACR > 30 mg/g is a hallmark of early kidney damage; 134 mg/g indicates moderate albuminuria.
Proteinuria 0.155 g/day
Mild‑moderate
Adds to evidence of glomerular injury.
BMI 31.2 (obese)
Moderately increases risk
Obesity is linked to hyperfiltration and progressive CKD.
Blood pressure 125/87 mmHg
Mildly elevated diastolic
Even within “pre‑hypertensive” ranges, hypertension contributes to kidney injury over time.
Diabetes history & HbA1c 5.48 %
Protective if controlled
Current glycaemic control is good, but a family history of diabetes adds background risk.
Medications
ACE‑inhibitor use is nephro‑protective; NSAIDs (≈0.7 ×/wk) can worsen kidney function; diuretics may cause electrolyte shifts.
Meds reflect both therapeutic and potential nephrotoxic exposure.
Lifestyle & labs
Normal sleep, moderate alcohol, reasonable activity; these are neutral or slightly protective.
However, low diet quality (1.6/10) may contribute to metabolic derangements that can harm kidneys.
Overall assessmentThe combination of a markedly elevated serum creatinine, albuminuria, and a family history of kidney disease outweighs the protective factors of young age and good glycaemic control. Therefore, a moderately high chronic kidney disease risk (≈70‑80/100) is appropriate.

The provided data indicates a relatively high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points supporting this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease.
2. **Elevated ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 157.96445625552207 mg/g is significantly above the normal range, suggesting kidney damage or disease, as it indicates the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which is a marker for kidney damage.
3. **Low GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: A GFR of 19.525556118124772 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function. GFR is a critical measure of kidney health, and lower values suggest a reduced ability of the kidneys to filter waste from the blood.
4. **Presence of Edema and Other Symptoms**: Symptoms like edema (swelling), fatigue, and muscle cramps can be associated with kidney disease, although they are non-specific and can have many other causes.
5. **Medication Use**: The use of NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with frequent use, as indicated (3.9377024658788393 times/week).
6. **Suboptimal Diet and Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is relatively good (7.277557173285846/10) and physical activity is high (8.570971895598575 hours/week), the presence of some risk factors like the use of NSAIDs and lower health literacy (0.3645290771903764/10) could negatively impact kidney health.
7. **Lipid Profile**: Elevated total cholesterol (298.02383437235255 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (185.2039798707208 mg/dL) may contribute to cardiovascular risk factors, which are also risk factors for kidney disease.

However, the absence of previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury), UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections), and the use of statins (which can help manage cholesterol levels and potentially offer some kidney protection) are positive factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could indicate potential issues with blood pressure regulation and vascular health.
3. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is significantly elevated at 157.96445625552207 mg/g, which is a strong indicator of kidney damage or disease. Normal ACR values are typically below 30 mg/g for people without kidney disease.
4. **GFR**: The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is decreased at 19.525556118124772 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function. A normal GFR is approximately 90-120 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher.
5. **Electrolyte and Mineral Imbalances**: The presence of slightly imbalanced electrolyte levels, such as potassium and phosphorus, can be indicative of kidney function issues, as the kidneys play a critical role in regulating electrolyte balance.
6. **Symptoms**: The presence of edema, fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching can be associated with kidney disease, though they are non-specific and can have many other causes.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can pose a risk to kidney function over time. However, the positive aspect is the adherence to statin medication, which can help manage cholesterol levels and potentially reduce cardiovascular risk factors associated with CKD.

Despite these risk factors, it's essential to consider the overall clinical context, including the absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, higher physical activity levels, and a relatively good diet quality, which are protective factors. Regular medical check-ups and high medication adherence are also positive indicators of health management. However, the low health literacy score may hinder optimal management of kidney health without proper guidance. 

Given these considerations, the calculated risk score reflects a significant concern for CKD, warranting close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly further diagnostic evaluation to accurately assess kidney function and guide management",74,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 82/100  

**Rationale (key points)**  
1. **Renal function** – GFR is 19.5 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD Stage 4) and albumin‑creatinine ratio (157 mg/g) is markedly elevated, indicating significant kidney damage.  
2. **Proteinuria** – 0.47 g/day of protein in urine further signals progression risk.  
3. **Clinical symptoms** – Presence of edema, fatigue, and itching are typical of advanced CKD.  
4. **Risk modifiers** –  
   - **Age** (61 y) and **Asian ethnicity** add to baseline risk.  
   - **NSAID use** (~4 times/wk) can worsen renal function",82.0,Caucasian,Asian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory results, and lifestyle factors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* Family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing CKD
* Elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 157.96445625552207 mg/g, indicating potential kidney damage
* Low estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of 19.525556118124772 mL/min/1.73 m², suggesting impaired kidney function
* Presence of edema, fatigue, and muscle cramps, which are common symptoms of CKD
* History of statin use, which may be related to cardiovascular disease, a common comorbidity with CKD
* Suboptimal health behaviors, including low health literacy and relatively low adherence to medication
* The absence of ACE inhibitors and diuretics in the medication list, which are commonly used to manage CKD

However, some factors reduce the risk score, such as:
* No previous AKI or UTIs
* No family history of kidney disease or hypertension
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals
* Relatively high physical activity level and good diet quality

2. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (185.63 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.03%) suggest diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, which are major risk factors for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in urine (4.07 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 87.80 mg/g indicate kidney damage.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 67.26 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range (>90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **Hypertension**: Systolic BP of 138 mmHg and diastolic BP of 94 mmHg are elevated, and hypertension is a significant risk factor for CKD.
6. **Medications and Substances**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency (5.04 times/week), can affect kidney function and contribute to CKD risk.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the BMI (24.80) and alcohol consumption (13.46 units/week) are within relatively safe ranges, the diet quality (4.18/10) could be improved to reduce CKD risk.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors. Main points contributing to this score include:
- **Family History of Kidney Disease:** Although there's no family history of kidney disease, the presence of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a significant risk factor.
- **Hypertension and Diabetes Indicators:** Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (138/94 mmHg) and high fasting glucose (185.6340049428315 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.02589339431141%) levels suggest hypertension and potential pre-diabetic or diabetic conditions, which are major risk factors for CKD.
- **Kidney Function:** The slightly reduced GFR (67.26306810516104 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (1.0100353310666843 mg/dL) levels indicate some degree of kidney impairment.
- **Proteinuria:** The presence of protein in urine (4.069198380180763 g/day) and a high ACR (87.80043217400274 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage.
- **Electrolyte and Lipid Profiles:** While electrolytes are mostly within range, the lipid profile shows high total cholesterol (227.98552924410063 mg/dL) and triglycerides (315.6761127105977 mg/dL), which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and, by extension, CKD risk.
- **Medications and Symptoms:** The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, despite their potential to affect kidney function, and the presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, further suggest renal impairment.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors:** Although the BMI is within a relatively healthy range, and there's no smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, the diet quality is moderate, and physical activity could be higher. Regular medical checkups and good medication adherence are positives, but health literacy could be improved.

These factors cumulatively contribute to a significant risk score for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100

Category
Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
Renal Function
GFR = 67.3 mL/min/1.73 m
2
 (Stage 3a), Proteinuria = 4.07 g/day, ACR = 87.8 mg/g
Mildly reduced filtration and significant proteinuria strongly indicate existing CKD and a higher probability of progression.
Blood Pressure
Systolic 138 mmHg, Diastolic 94 mmHg
Hypertension is a primary driver of renal damage; these values are above optimal and increase CKD progression risk.
Glycemic Control
Fasting glucose 185.6 mg/dL, HbA1c 8.0%
Poor glucose control (diabetes‑related hyperglycemia) accelerates nephron loss.
Medication & Exposure
Frequent NSAID use (5 times/week), no ACEi/ARBs
NSAIDs can worsen kidney perfusion; absence of renoprotective agents (ACEi/ARBs) reduces protective therapy.
Lifestyle & Other Factors
BMI 24.8 (normal), moderate physical activity, good sleep, high alcohol (13 units/week)
While BMI and activity are favorable, alcohol intake approaches upper limits; overall lifestyle mitigates but does not offset major risk markers.
Previous Events
Prior AKI episode
History of AKI is a known predictor of CKD onset and acceleration.
Lipid Profile
Total cholesterol 228 mg/dL, LDL 127 mg/dL, triglycerides 316 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to vascular disease and can exacerbate renal microvascular damage.
Combining these factors—moderate‑stage CKD, significant proteinuria, hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, NSAID exposure, and a prior AKI event—the overall estimated risk of CKD progression or complications over the next several years is moderately high, yielding a score of 78 out of 100.",78.0,Caucasian,Asian

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data given, including demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and current health status. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Family History:** Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI is a significant risk factor.
3. **Blood Pressure:** Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (138/94 mmHg) is a risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c:** High fasting glucose (185.634 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.025%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for kidney damage.
5. **Kidney Function Tests:** The GFR (67.263 mL/min/1.73 m²) is below the normal range, indicating some level of kidney impairment. The creatinine level (1.010 mg/dL) and BUN level (6.945 mg/dL) also suggest impaired kidney function.
6. **Protein in Urine:** The presence of protein in urine (4.069 g/day) with an ACR of 87.800 mg/g is indicative of kidney damage.
7. **Lifestyle Factors:** While the BMI (24.798) is within a relatively healthy range, and there's no smoking, the alcohol consumption (13.463 units/week) and moderate physical activity (5.435 hours/week) could contribute to the risk.
8. **Medications and Symptoms:** The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, despite their therapeutic benefits, can affect kidney function, especially with frequent NSAID use (5.036 times/week).
9. **Quality of Life and Health Behaviors:** Fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score (63.362), may reflect underlying health issues, including potential kidney disease.

The risk score is based on several factors that indicate a moderate to high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

* Family history of hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
* Elevated blood pressure ( systolic BP: 94 mmHg, diastolic BP: 117 mmHg), with the diastolic value being higher than the normal range, indicating potential vascular issues.
* High creatinine levels (3.4306438365938208 mg/dL) and relatively high BUN levels (26.71402952950055 mg/dL), suggesting impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (3.0623514072810467 g/day) and a high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 115.1550885594326 mg/g, which are indicators of kidney damage.
* Use of ACE inhibitors, which can be a marker for hypertension management but also indicate a potential kidney protective measure.
* Elevated triglycerides (169.85745646638003 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (164.08996493116126 mg/dL), which can contribute to vascular disease and indirectly affect kidney health.
* The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, which can be symptoms associated with CKD, though non-specific.
* Good adherence to medication and regular medical checkups are positive factors but do not outweigh the cumulative risk from other factors.

Despite a good diet quality, physical activity level, and lack of smoking, the presence of multiple risk factors and indicators of kidney stress or damage contribute to the elevated risk score.

Rationale
Category
Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
Age & Sex
69‑year‑old female
Advanced age elevates risk; women tend to progress slower but have higher prevalence of hypertension‑related CKD
Kidney Function
Creatinine 3.43 mg/dL (high), GFR 112 mL/min/1.73 m² (reported but inconsistent with creatinine), proteinuria 3.06 g/day (severe), ACR 115 mg/g (moderate)
Severe proteinuria and a creatinine level well above the normal range strongly suggest ongoing kidney injury; the discordant GFR figure is likely a calculation error but the proteinuria outweighs it.
Blood Pressure & Medications
BP 94/117 mmHg (diastolic‑dominant), on ACE‑inhibitor
Diastolic‑dominant hypertension and ACE‑inhibitor use reflect a history of hypertension, a major CKD driver.
Lifestyle & Exposures
NSAID use 7–8 ×/week
Recurrent NSAID exposure is a powerful risk factor for both acute and chronic kidney damage.
Metabolic Status
HbA1c 5.25% (normal), fasting glucose 108 mg/dL (prediabetes)
Not currently diabetic, but borderline hyperglycemia can accelerate CKD if uncontrolled.
Symptoms & QoL
Fatigue 7/10, nausea 5–6 ×/week, muscle cramps 5–6 ×/week, QoL 27/100
These subjective signs suggest existing renal insufficiency and impaired well‑being.
Other Labs
LDL 164 mg/dL, triglycerides 170 mg/dL, HDL 31 mg/dL
Unfavorable lipid profile increases vascular risk, which can contribute to CKD progression.
Protective Factors
Normal BMI (24.9), moderate alcohol, 9 h/week physical activity, good medication adherence
These help moderate overall risk but do not offset the strong adverse indicators above.
Combining these elements—particularly the high proteinuria, elevated creatinine, heavy NSAID use, and age—the overall CKD risk is moderate to high.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 73 out of 100, indicating a significant risk. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **History of UTIs**: The presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) can indicate underlying kidney or urinary tract issues that may predispose to CKD.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 158 mmHg is higher than the recommended level, and high blood pressure is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Fasting Glucose Levels**: A fasting glucose level of 118.45508563334236 mg/dL is near the upper limit of normal and may indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of CKD.
5. **Creatinine and GFR Levels**: While the GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is within the normal range, the creatinine level is slightly elevated, which could be an early indicator of kidney function decline.
6. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 54.28348627124847 mg/g is elevated, indicating the presence of proteinuria, a common sign of kidney damage.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The BMI of 27.36885601089259 indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for CKD. The relatively low level of physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption may also contribute to the risk.
8. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) and exposure to heavy metals can be harmful to kidney function and contribute to the risk of CKD.

These factors combined suggest a higher risk of developing CKD, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly therapeutic interventions to mitigate these risks. Regular medical checkups, improved medication adherence, and enhanced health literacy can play crucial roles in managing and reducing the risk of CKD progression.",73,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 38/100**

The risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:
- **Family History**: The presence of a family history of diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD, increases the risk.
- **Hypertension**: Elevated blood pressure (158/99 mmHg) is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney blood vessels.
- **Diabetes Indicators**: Although HbA1c is within the normal range, the fasting glucose level (118.45508563334236 mg/dL) suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can predispose to diabetes and CKD.
- **Kidney Function**: The GFR (119.5044637418698 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (0.1514209642049563 g/day) and an elevated ACR (54.28348627124847 mg/g) indicate early signs of kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: While the individual does not smoke and has good sleep quality, the high BMI (27.36885601089259), moderate alcohol consumption (10.56704245102472 units/week), and relatively low physical activity (2.726305088675055 hours/week) contribute to the risk.
- **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (7.52826565128105 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and exposure to heavy metals increases the risk of CKD.
- **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups (2.5391666579350245 per year) and fair medication adherence (2.2420066657724846/10) are noted, but these factors alone do not sufficiently mitigate the overall risk.

The provided data indicate a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this assessment include:
1. **Impaired Renal Function**: Indicated by a GFR of 25.64636355585676 mL/min/1.73 m², which is significantly lower than the normal range, suggesting a substantial reduction in kidney function.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine level is at 4.696184420449854 mg/dL, and BUN is at 13.609851363060994 mg/dL, both of which are indicators of impaired kidney function.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.2208219431198832 g/day) and an elevated ACR (262.60715571854354 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage.
4. **Hypertension**: Although the current blood pressure (110/77 mmHg) is not excessively high, the use of diuretics suggests that blood pressure management might be an issue, and hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
5. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality can increase the risk of kidney disease due to potential contaminants.
6. **Medication Use**: The frequent use of NSAIDs (9.604611210891823 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and may exacerbate CKD.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is good and physical activity is high, the sleep quality is relatively poor, and health literacy is low, which might impact the ability to manage health conditions effectively.
8. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of uremia or electrolyte imbalances associated with CKD.

Despite the absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and the good control of blood glucose levels, the cumulative effect of the above factors, especially the direct indicators of kidney impairment, contributes to a high risk score for CKD.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 88/100

The provided information suggests a relatively high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to several factors:

1. **Laboratory Results**: 
   - The patient's GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is 25.64636355585676 mL/min/1.73 m², which indicates a significant reduction in kidney function, placing the patient at stage 4 CKD, according to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines.
   - Elevated Creatinine and BUN levels also point towards compromised kidney function.
   - Protein in urine (ACR 262.60715571854354 mg/g) is close to the upper limit, suggesting kidney damage.

2. **Health and Lifestyle Factors**:
   - While the patient has no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the current systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are at the lower end of the normal range but given the significant reduction in GFR, the blood pressure management might be crucial.
   - The patient's diet quality is good, and physical activity level is high, both of which are protective factors. However, sleep quality is somewhat compromised, which could impact overall health.

3. **Medications and Symptoms**:
   - The use of diuretics and NSAIDs could potentially worsen renal function in the long term, especially considering the already compromised state of the kidneys.
   - Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps are common in CKD and can significantly impact the quality of life.

4. **Exposures and Behaviors**:
   - Poor water quality could potentially expose the individual to harmful substances that might further impair kidney function.
   - The frequency of medical checkups is somewhat inadequate, and medication adherence, while good, could be improved. Health literacy is low, which might hinder the ability to manage the condition effectively.

Given these factors, the risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or experiencing significant complications from CKD is relatively high, hence the risk score of 73/100. Effective management strategies, including lifestyle modifications, careful monitoring of kidney function, and possibly adjusting medications to minimize nephrotoxicity, are crucial to mitigating this risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively moderate, considering the provided information. The main points that contribute to this score include:

* **Normal kidney function indicators**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is within the normal range (100.97 mL/min/1.73 m²), and the creatinine level is also within the normal range (0.75 mg/dL), indicating good kidney function.
* **Family history and previous kidney issues**: There is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and no previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs), which reduces the risk.
* **Blood pressure and glucose control**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are within normal ranges (102/77 mmHg), and fasting glucose (94.58 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.63%) levels are also within normal limits, indicating good glucose control.
* **Diet, lifestyle, and physical activity**: The diet quality is moderate (5.58/10), physical activity is relatively high (8.22 hours/week), and there is no smoking, which are all positive factors. However, alcohol consumption is moderate to high (18.12 units/week), which could have negative effects on kidney health.
* **Electrolyte and lipid profiles**: Electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, but the total cholesterol (212.58 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (193.79 mg/dL) are slightly elevated, which could be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, by extension, kidney disease.
* **Medications and symptoms**: The use of antidiabetic medications without a clear indication of diabetes suggests potential prediabetic conditions or insulin resistance, which could impact kidney health. The presence of some symptoms like fatigue (9.92/10) and nausea/vomiting (6.07 times/week) could indicate underlying issues, but their direct relation to kidney disease risk is less clear without further context.
* **Health behaviors and exposures**: Regular medical checkups (3.83 times/year) and good medication adherence (8.95/10) are positive factors, but limited health literacy (2.88/10) could hinder the management of health conditions.

In summary, while there are several positive indicators of low to moderate risk for chronic kidney disease, factors such as moderate to high alcohol",23,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 35/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively low, considering the provided information. The main points supporting this score include:

1. **Normal GFR**: A GFR of 100.966 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates normal kidney function.
2. **Absence of Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
3. **Normal Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within normal ranges.
4. **Good ACR and Protein in Urine**: Although the ACR is slightly elevated, it is not significantly high, and protein in urine is still within a relatively acceptable range.
5. **Lack of Certain Medications**: Not taking ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which can affect kidney function, might contribute to a lower risk, but the use of NSAIDs could potentially increase risk.
6. **No Heavy Metals or Chemical Exposure**: Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals reduce the risk of kidney damage.
7. **Regular Medical Checkups and Good Medication Adherence**: Frequent medical checkups and high adherence to medication contribute to better health management and potentially lower risk.

However, factors that might slightly increase the risk include:

1. **Elevated LDL Cholesterol and Triglycerides**: High levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are linked to CKD.
2. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs can be harmful to kidney function over time.
3. **Presence of Antidiabetic Medications**: The use of antidiabetic medications suggests some level of glucose metabolism issue, which could indirectly affect kidney health.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided clinical and lifestyle data. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which is favorable.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic BP are within relatively normal ranges, not significantly contributing to the risk.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (161 mg/dL) and slightly elevated HbA1c (4.9%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, potentially predisposing to CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: Creatinine is slightly elevated (1.30 mg/dL), and GFR is reduced (68.78 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating some level of kidney impairment. The BUN level is also elevated (46.26 mg/dL), which can be a sign of kidney dysfunction.
5. **Proteinuria**: Significant protein in urine (2.92 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR of 146.76 mg/g) are strong indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: Within normal ranges, not significantly impacting the CKD risk.
7. **Lipid Profile**: Elevated total and LDL cholesterol may contribute to cardiovascular risk, indirectly affecting kidney health.
8. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of antidiabetic medications and the presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be related to underlying kidney issues.

Reduced GFR: 68.8 mL/min/1.73 m² falls into CKD stage 3a, indicating early but established kidney impairment.
Diabetes indicators: Fasting glucose 161 mg/dL and ongoing antidiabetic medication suggest uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes, a major CKD driver.
NSAID use: 7.8 times per week elevates risk of acute on chronic injury and can worsen GFR decline.
Lipid profile: Total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, LDL 184 mg/dL, and low HDL 34 mg/dL increase cardiovascular and renal risk.
Low blood pressure (91/67 mmHg) is atypical for CKD but may reflect early autonomic or renal dysfunction; nevertheless, it does not mitigate the other strong risk factors.
Symptoms and QoL: Frequent nausea and muscle cramps, plus a low QoL score (29/100), suggest that CKD is already affecting overall well‑being.
Lifestyle factors: Moderate activity and diet quality (6.5/10) provide limited protective effect; alcohol intake is within normal limits.
All these variables combine to place the patient in a high‑risk category for progression to advanced CKD or ESRD if interventions are not intensified.",78.0,African American,Caucasian

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors from the provided data. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Current Kidney Function**: The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 68.77540151000318 mL/min/1.73 m², which is below the normal range (90 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher), indicating impaired kidney function.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in urine (2.919098339733889 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 146.7679531470046 mg/g are significant indicators of kidney damage.
4. **Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure is within a relatively normal range but on the lower side, which might not directly contribute to CKD risk in this context.
5. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (161.02107622572518 mg/dL) and slightly elevated HbA1c (4.907898770896273%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of antidiabetic medications indicates management of diabetes, but NSAID use (7.823886760885241 times/week) can potentially harm kidney function. Good adherence to medications and relatively good health literacy are positive factors.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 26.01914503591353 indicates overweight status, which can contribute to the risk of CKD. Low physical activity (0.2195350187702072 hours/week) and moderate alcohol consumption (7.45740661361721 units/week) also contribute to health risks.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, primarily due to existing kidney function impairment, proteinuria, and factors like elevated fasting glucose and overweight status.

The risk score of 34/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided demographic, lifestyle, medical history, and clinical data. The main points influencing this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is slightly elevated at 131 mmHg, which, although not severely high, contributes to the risk when considered in conjunction with other factors.
3. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is 110.46 mg/g, which is above the normal range, indicating some level of kidney damage or disease.
4. **GFR**: The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 99.87 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, suggesting no significant reduction in kidney function at this time.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI (26.2), moderate alcohol consumption, and relatively low diet quality contribute to the risk, as these factors are associated with an increased risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
6. **Use of NSAIDs**: Regular use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) can be nephrotoxic and contribute to CKD risk, especially with frequent use (nearly 5 times/week in this case).

Despite these risk factors, the absence of diabetes, previous AKI, UTIs, and a relatively good quality of life, along with normal creatinine and BUN levels, temper the risk score.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided comprehensive health profile. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure readings (131/113 mmHg) are on the higher side, with the diastolic being particularly elevated. Elevated blood pressure is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.3572077524844697 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR of 110.46250225621422 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage, which increases the risk of CKD progression.
4. **BMI and Diet Quality**: A BMI of 26.199886366721703 indicates overweight status, and a diet quality score of 2.8011270230656535/10 suggests room for improvement in dietary habits, both of which can impact kidney health.
5. **Lack of Certain Medications**: Not being on ACE inhibitors, which are known to protect kidney function in individuals with or at risk of CKD, might contribute to a higher risk score, given the presence of other risk factors.
6. **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (4.996349146079705 times/week) can impair kidney function and increase CKD risk.
7. **Physical Activity and Sleep Quality**: While physical activity is somewhat low (3.114954247276019 hours/week), sleep quality is relatively average (5.816348776469315/10), which has mixed implications for overall health and potentially for CKD risk.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **No Previous AKI or UTIs**: The absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs) lowers the risk.
- **Good Water Quality and No Heavy Metals Exposure**: These reduce the likelihood of external toxins affecting kidney health.
- **High Socioeconomic Status and Education**: These factors can contribute to better healthcare access and health literacy, potentially leading to more effective disease management and prevention strategies.

SummaryThe patient shows early renal impairment (moderate albuminuria and proteinuria) coupled with elevated diastolic blood pressure and frequent NSAID use—both strong contributors to CKD progression. However, her preserved GFR, absence of diabetes, and relatively healthy lifestyle factors lower the overall risk. Combining these elements yields a moderate risk score of ~42/100. Regular monitoring, blood‑pressure control, and reducing NSAID exposure would be prudent to prevent progression.",42.0,Asian,Asian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 131 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 113 mmHg are both on the higher side, which can increase the risk of kidney damage over time.
3. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 110.46250225621422 mg/g indicates the presence of proteinuria, a sign of kidney damage.
4. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: While not severely impaired, the diet quality score of 2.8011270230656535/10 and physical activity of 3.114954247276019 hours/week could be improved to better support kidney health.
5. **Laboratory Values**: The serum creatinine and fasting glucose levels are within normal ranges, which is positive. However, the slightly elevated BUN level could indicate a need for monitoring.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs 4.996349146079705 times/week could potentially strain kidney function over time. Regular medical checkups and good medication adherence are crucial for early detection and management of any kidney issues.

These factors contribute to a moderate risk of developing chronic kidney disease. However, it's essential to note that many of these factors can be managed through lifestyle adjustments, regular monitoring, and, if necessary, medical intervention.

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Yes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP is 131 mmHg and diastolic BP is 113 mmHg, both of which are elevated and contribute to the risk of CKD.
3. **Kidney Function**: The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 99.86565434355616 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (1.3572077524844697 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 110.46250225621422 mg/g suggest some level of kidney stress or damage.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is moderate (2.8011270230656535/10), physical activity is relatively low (3.114954247276019 hours/week), and alcohol consumption is moderate (10.194849000852413 units/week), these factors do not significantly elevate the risk but do contribute to the overall score.
5. **Medical History and Medications**: The use of NSAIDs (4.996349146079705 times/week) can increase the risk of CKD due to their potential nephrotoxic effects.

3.44 g/day; 181 mg/g
Markedly elevated values indicate glomerular damage; a major risk marker for CKD progression.
Creatinine
3.45 mg/dL
Elevated creatinine suggests impaired filtration, despite a normal‑appearing GFR (possible lab variability or early compensatory hyperfiltration).
Glucose control
Fasting glucose 105.6 mg/dL; HbA1c 6.49%
Pre‑diabetic range; hyperglycemia contributes to diabetic nephropathy.
NSAID use
~3 times per week
Chronic NSAID exposure can worsen kidney function, especially in the presence of proteinuria.
BMI
26.7
Overweight status modestly elevates CKD risk.
Lifestyle & comorbidities
Normal BP, moderate alcohol, adequate physical activity, but low diet quality (3.9/10)
These factors add to cumulative risk but are not primary drivers.
Other labs
Normal electrolytes, BUN, hemoglobin slightly low
Provide context but do not offset the high proteinuria and hyperglycemia.
Combining these elements, the overall CKD risk is moderate‑to‑high (~70 % probability of CKD development or progression over the next decade), hence the 72/100 score.",72.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health metrics. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Yes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
* Family history: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could lower the risk, but this is counterbalanced by other factors.
* Blood pressure: Systolic BP/Diastolic BP is 102/80 mmHg, which is within a relatively normal range but on the higher end for diastolic, suggesting some potential for impact on kidney health over time.
* Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels: 105.62557595045752 mg/dL and 6.485374093635137%, respectively, indicating prediabetic conditions, which increase the risk of CKD.
* Creatinine level: 3.4491205392329904 mg/dL, which is elevated and suggests impaired kidney function.
* GFR: 102.8399300736647 mL/min/1.73 m², which is actually higher than normal, suggesting hyperfiltration, a potential early sign of kidney stress.
* Protein in urine: 3.437444309971538 g/day, and ACR 181.76243927056703 mg/g, both of which are significantly elevated and indicate kidney damage.
* Electrolytes and cholesterol levels: While some values are within normal ranges, others (like LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) are high, potentially increasing cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to CKD risk.
* Medications: Use of statins and antidiabetic medications suggests management of cardiovascular and diabetic risks but also indicates the presence of these conditions.
* Symptoms and QoL: Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, suggest significant impact on daily life, potentially related to CKD.
* Exposures and health behaviors: Good water quality, no heavy metals or chemical exposure, regular medical checkups, and good medication adherence are positive factors, but their impact is overshadowed by the presence of significant risk factors.

The provided risk score is based on various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here are the main points considering the given data:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Previous AKI**: History of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) increases the risk of CKD.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 102 mmHg and diastolic BP of 80 mmHg are within normal ranges, reducing the risk.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Fasting glucose is slightly elevated, and HbA1c is near the upper limit of normal, indicating borderline diabetes control, which increases the risk.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: Creatinine is elevated at 3.449 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. The GFR is 102.8 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range but on the higher side for someone with elevated creatinine, suggesting potential kidney stress or early damage.
6. **Protein in Urine**: Elevated protein in urine (3.437 g/day) and high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR of 181.762 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage.
7. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, along with high triglycerides, may contribute to vascular disease, including kidney vascular disease.
8. **Medications**: The use of statins and antidiabetic medications is beneficial, but the lack of ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which are protective for kidney function, is notable.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of nausea/vomiting, fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a lower QoL score, indicates a significant impact on health and potential underlying issues.
10. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups, good medication adherence, and high health literacy are positive factors.

Given these points, the risk score of 73/100 reflects a significant risk due to indicators of kidney damage (elevated creatinine, proteinuria), previous AKI, borderline diabetes control, and the presence of symptoms affecting quality of life, despite some protective factors like normal blood pressure and good health behaviors",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 68/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on several factors, including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, and current health status. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (174/102 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney blood vessels.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 2.025 g/day of protein in the urine is an indicator of kidney damage.
4. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An elevated ACR of 142.048 mg/g suggests kidney damage and is a risk factor for CKD progression.
5. **Reduced Kidney Function**: Although the GFR (102.958 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the elevated creatinine level (1.375 mg/dL) and BUN level (35.725 mg/dL) may indicate early kidney dysfunction.
6. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 57 years old and having a low socioeconomic status may also contribute to a higher risk of CKD, as these factors can impact access to healthcare and the ability to manage chronic conditions.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for controlling hypertension and slowing CKD progression, but the frequency of NSAID use (10 times/week) may be detrimental to kidney function due to its potential to reduce blood flow to the kidneys.

These factors combined contribute to a higher risk score for chronic kidney disease. It is essential to monitor kidney function, manage hypertension, and adjust lifestyle and medication use under medical supervision to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Factor
Evidence & Impact on CKD Risk
Hypertension (SBP 174 mmHg / DBP 102 mmHg)
Severe, untreated hypertension is a leading cause of CKD progression.
Proteinuria (2 g/day) & ACR 142 mg/g
Substantial albumin excretion indicates glomerular injury and strongly predicts future decline in eGFR.
eGFR (≈103 mL/min/1.73 m²)
Currently normal, but the presence of proteinuria and hypertension suggests a high likelihood of future loss of function.
Race (Black)
Black individuals have a higher baseline risk for CKD and faster progression once kidney damage begins.
Family history of kidney disease
Genetic susceptibility amplifies risk.
NSAID use (≈10 times/week)
Chronic NSAID exposure can cause interstitial nephritis and exacerbate hypertension‑related damage.
Anemia (Hb 11.4 g/dL)
Reflects early renal dysfunction and is associated with worse outcomes.
Lipid profile (TC 299 mg/dL, LDL 139 mg/dL, TG 202 mg/dL)
Dyslipidemia contributes to vascular damage within the kidney.
Lifestyle
BMI ~25, non‑smoker, moderate alcohol, good diet and sleep reduce but do not eliminate risk.
Medication
ACE inhibitor is protective; lack of statin or other nephroprotective agents is a missed opportunity.
SummaryThe combination of severe hypertension, marked proteinuria, familial predisposition, and frequent NSAID use places the patient at high short‑term risk for CKD progression even though current eGFR is still within the normal range. A score of 78/100 reflects substantial risk that warrants aggressive blood‑pressure control, initiation of statin therapy, review of NSAID usage, and close monitoring of renal function and albumin excretion.",78.0,Caucasian,Black

- **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.0254205836137 g/day of protein in the urine is indicative of kidney damage.
- **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine (1.3750191352557513 mg/dL) and BUN (35.72593025714538 mg/dL) levels are higher than ideal, suggesting impaired kidney function.
- **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs (9.999396960457185 times/week) can impact kidney function, with NSAIDs potentially being harmful in large quantities.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Although diet quality is good (9.218536737859097/10) and physical activity is moderate (5.472460421002872 hours/week), alcohol consumption (6.268267297073402 units/week) and lower sleep quality (5.61788716983767/10) could contribute to health issues.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms like fatigue (3.9567141468796496/10), nausea/vomiting (1.9936009268806176 times/week), and itching (4.068096048715755/10) may indicate underlying issues affecting kidney health or overall well-being.

However, factors such as good diet quality, absence of smoking, and higher education level may help mitigate some risks. The relatively high GFR (102.95813161469448 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggests that while there are risk factors, the current kidney function is still within a relatively normal range.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is moderately high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, the presence of other risk factors compensates for this in the overall risk assessment.
2. **Previous AKI and UTIs**: The history of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) is a notable risk factor, as recurrent infections can increase the risk of kidney damage over time. However, there's no previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which could have significantly raised the risk.
3. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (122/77 mmHg) are within a relatively normal range, which is favorable.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is at the lower end of the given range, and the HbA1c is slightly elevated at 8.068%, indicating some level of glucose metabolism issue, which can be a risk factor for kidney disease.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The Creatinine level is elevated at 4.007 mg/dL, and the GFR is 78.986 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating some impairment in kidney function. The BUN level is also elevated, which can indicate decreased kidney function.
6. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.1809306523793258 g/day) and the Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 5.96241930678022 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
7. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, which can be risk factors for cardiovascular disease and, by extension, CKD.
8. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests management of hypertension and possibly proteinuria, which are common in CKD.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, may indicate the presence of CKD symptoms affecting daily life.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Laboratory Results**: The patient has a slightly elevated creatinine level (4.007018467411724 mg/dL) and a borderline GFR (78.98622625364064 mL/min/1.73 m²), which are critical markers for kidney function. Although the GFR is still within a relatively normal range, the combination with other factors contributes to the risk.

2. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.1809306523793258 g/day) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.96241930678022 mg/g indicate kidney damage, a key factor in CKD development.

3. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's blood pressure (122/77 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, which is a positive factor. However, the use of ACE inhibitors suggests that blood pressure might have been a concern in the past, requiring management.

4. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The patient is on ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which can affect kidney function and are often used in managing conditions related to CKD. NSAIDs use is frequent (6.921047728110984 times/week), which can be harmful to kidney function.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the patient has a healthy BMI, diet quality, and sleep quality, the relatively low physical activity (3.2324531705947166 hours/week) and moderate alcohol consumption (5.45354104788963 units/week) could contribute to overall health risks, including CKD.

6. **Medical History and Symptoms**: The history of UTIs and presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate underlying kidney issues or complications that could exacerbate CKD risk.

7. **Family and Social Factors**: The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk. However, high socioeconomic status and access to healthcare might influence health behaviors and management of risk factors.

Considering these factors, the risk score reflects a significant concern for CKD development or progression, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly reevaluation of medication use to mitigate risks.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 76/100
Rationale (key points)
Renal function – Creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL and GFR of ≈79 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate stage‑2 CKD with a substantial decline in filtration; this alone contributes heavily to the overall risk.
Proteinuria & ACR – While protein excretion (0.18 g/day) and ACR (~6 mg/g) are within normal limits, the markedly elevated creatinine suggests that early glomerular damage may already be progressing.
Metabolic derangements – An HbA1c of 8.1 % signals poorly controlled hyperglycaemia, a major risk factor for CKD progression, even though fasting glucose is normal.
Medication & exposure – Chronic NSAID use (≈7 × week) and ACE‑inhibitor/diuretic therapy together raise the risk of nephrotoxicity and volume depletion.
Lifestyle & comorbidities – Good diet and moderate activity mitigate risk slightly, but low medication adherence (≈2/10) and frequent urinary infections (UTIs) increase vulnerability.
Demographics – Younger age (39 y) is protective, yet the combination of biochemical markers and risk‑enhancing behaviours pushes the overall estimate toward the upper middle‑range of CKD risk.",76.0,Caucasian,Asian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is moderate to high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient's GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is 78.98622625364064 mL/min/1.73 m², which is slightly below the normal range (90-120 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating a potential reduction in kidney function. Additionally, the Creatinine level is on the higher end of the normal range, and the BUN Level is elevated, suggesting possible kidney stress or impairment.

2. **Protein in Urine (Albuminuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.1809306523793258 g/day) is a significant predictor of kidney disease progression. The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 5.96241930678022 mg/g is slightly elevated, indicating early signs of kidney damage.

3. **Family and Medical History**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient has a history of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections), which can be a risk factor for developing CKD if recurrent or severe.

4. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient has a good diet quality and physical activity level but consumes alcohol and has a history of NSAIDs use, both of which can affect kidney function over time. The medication adherence and health literacy scores are low, which could impact the management of potential kidney issues.

5. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, but the lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and, indirectly, to kidney disease progression.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score, may indicate underlying issues that could be related to kidney function or other systemic conditions affecting kidney health.

Considering these factors, the patient is at a moderate to high risk for chronic kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Medical History**: Previous UTIs may slightly increase the risk, but the absence of previous AKI is a positive factor.
3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - **GFR**: A GFR of 78.986 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, indicating good kidney function.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in urine (0.1809306523793258 g/day) and an ACR of 5.96241930678022 mg/g suggests some degree of kidney damage or disease.
   - **Electrolytes and Metabolic Parameters**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are mostly within normal ranges, which is positive.
4. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension or proteinuria, which can be protective, but also suggests the presence of conditions that require such management.
5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate QoL score, suggest some impact on daily life that could be related to underlying health issues.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups are positive, but low medication adherence and health literacy scores are concerning and could negatively impact disease management.

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which might lower the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (179 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. **Kidney Function**: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is within the normal range (92.90175271949272 mL/min/1.73 m²), but the presence of protein in urine (3.042360585122478 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (50.56756881609124 mg/g) indicate potential kidney stress or damage.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption are risk factors. The high body mass index (BMI) and relatively low physical activity level also contribute to the risk.
5. **Laboratory Results**: The hemoglobin level is slightly below the normal range, which could indicate anemia, a common complication of CKD. Electrolyte levels, while mostly within normal ranges, show a potassium level at the upper limit of normal, which could be relevant in the context of kidney function.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs regularly could further increase the risk of kidney damage due to their potential nephrotoxic effects. Poor medication adherence and low health literacy might also complicate the management of any existing condition.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying issues, including potential electrolyte imbalances or early signs of CKD.

2. **Proteinuria / ACR** – 3 g/day protein and an ACR of 50 mg/g place the patient in a high‑risk category for renal damage, even though GFR is currently preserved.  
3. **Lifestyle factors** – BMI >30, smoking, frequent NSAID use (≈9 ×/week), low physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption contribute to vascular and renal stress.  
4. **Metabolic profile** – Elevated triglycerides (312 mg/dL), borderline low HDL, and a total cholesterol of 209 mg/dL increase atherosclerotic risk, which can worsen kidney perfusion.  
5. **Socio‑economic & behavioral risks** – Low SES, high medication non‑adherence, and limited health literacy compound the likelihood of uncontrolled risk factors.  
6. **Other renal indicators** – Mild anemia (Hb ≈ 10.8 g/dL) and borderline high BUN",78.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 179 mmHg is significantly higher than the normal range, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.042360 g/day of protein in the urine indicates kidney damage, a key marker for CKD.
3. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 50.09124 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption (352 units/week) are detrimental to kidney health.
5. **Physical Activity**: Low physical activity (0155 hours/week) contributes to a higher risk of developing CKD.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (9.103684 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially without proper medical supervision. Poor medication adherence (0./10) and low health literacy (605/10) may also hinder effective management of risk factors.
7. **Clinical Measurements**: Although the GFR (92.901752 mL/min/ m²) is within the normal range, the combination of other risk factors still poses a significant threat to kidney health.

These factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Management of blood pressure, reduction of harmful lifestyle habits, careful monitoring of kidney function, and adherence to prescribed medications are crucial to mitigate this risk.",100,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 65/100

The calculated risk score of 74/100 indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (179/88 mmHg) is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney blood vessels and reduce kidney function over time.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.042360585122478 g/day) and an elevated Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 50.56756881609124 mg/g are indicators of kidney damage.

3. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: High potassium levels (5.487144342981722 mEq/L) can be a sign of reduced kidney function, as the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating electrolyte balance.

4. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption (18.719462164189352 units/week) are lifestyle factors that can negatively impact kidney health. Smoking can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and worsen kidney function, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to dehydration and increased blood pressure, both of which can harm the kidneys.

5. **Obesity and Diet**: A high BMI (31.324818288542943) indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD. Although diet quality is relatively high (7.982021339813272/10), the overall lifestyle, including low physical activity (1.6007565896870155 hours/week), contributes to the risk.

6. **Lipid Profile**: High total cholesterol (208.67846398448827 mg/dL) and triglycerides (311.9525591092073 mg/dL) can contribute to vascular disease, which is a risk factor for CKD.

7. **Medication Use**: The use of NSAIDs (9.430638893103684 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use, as it can reduce blood flow to the kidneys.

8. **Health Behaviors**: Low adherence to medication (0.1578720922103194/10) and relatively low health literacy (5.554563489926605/10) can hinder the management of CKD risk factors and existing conditions.

The risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:
1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor, as it may predispose to higher blood pressure, a major contributor to CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 139 mmHg and diastolic of 96 mmHg indicate hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated levels (176.45 mg/dL and 8.13%, respectively) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: A level of 3.19 g/day is indicative of significant proteinuria, a key marker of kidney damage and a strong predictor of CKD progression.
5. **ACE Inhibitors Use**: While ACE inhibitors are used to protect the kidneys, their necessity in this case may indicate existing kidney concerns.
6. **BMI and Diet Quality**: A BMI of 29.49 indicates overweight status, and a diet quality score of 6.91/10 suggests room for improvement, both of which can impact kidney health.
7. **Previous UTIs**: History of urinary tract infections can increase the risk of CKD, especially if recurrent.

However, factors mitigating the risk include:
- **Good Sleep Quality**: High sleep quality can help in managing stress and potentially mitigating some CKD risk factors.
- **No Smoking and Moderate Alcohol Consumption**: These factors reduce the risk compared to those with smoking or high alcohol intake.
- **Use of Statins**: Can help manage cholesterol levels, which is beneficial for overall vascular health, including kidney health.

2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (139/96 mmHg) are higher than the ideal range, indicating potential kidney strain.
3. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (176.45 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.13%) suggest poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.19 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 151.68 mg/g indicate kidney damage.
5. **Use of ACE Inhibitors**: While ACE inhibitors can help manage conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, their use also suggests the presence of conditions that increase CKD risk.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 29.49 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD. Although the diet quality is relatively good (6.91/10) and physical activity is moderate (4.32 hours/week), the overall lifestyle could contribute to CKD risk.
7. **History of UTIs**: Previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) may indicate increased susceptibility to kidney infections or damage.

However, factors mitigating the risk include good sleep quality, absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and the use of statins, which can have protective effects on cardiovascular health and potentially reduce CKD risk.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD by causing chronic inflammation and damage to the kidneys.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 96 mmHg indicates hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 176.44652029313954 mg/dL and 8.13019632497218%, respectively, suggest poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: A level of 3.1895870145573246 g/day is indicative of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
6. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 151.6785046377113 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
7. **Use of ACE Inhibitors**: While ACE inhibitors can be protective of kidney function in the context of diabetes or proteinuria by reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of kidney disease, the need for these medications also indicates the presence of conditions that increase CKD risk.
8. **Suboptimal Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: Although diet quality is moderate and physical activity is somewhat regular, there is room for improvement to reduce CKD risk further.
9. **Low Socioeconomic Status and Limited Health Literacy**: These factors can lead to barriers in accessing healthcare, adhering to medication regimens, and adopting healthy lifestyle choices, potentially increasing the risk of CKD progression.

However, factors such as good sleep quality, absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and the use of statins for managing cholesterol levels contribute to a slightly lower risk score.

Rationale – Key risk contributors
Factor
Value
Impact on CKD risk
Age (53 yr)
• Moderately increases risk, especially with other comorbidities.

Ethnicity (Black)
• Higher baseline risk for CKD progression.

Blood pressure
139/96 mmHg – stage 1 hypertension; persistent elevation drives renal damage.

Glycemic markers
Fasting glucose 176 mg/dL & HbA1c 8.13% – indicate undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes, a major CKD driver.

Proteinuria
3.19 g/day & ACR 152 mg/g – moderate‑to‑high albumin excretion; a strong predictor of progression.

eGFR
97 mL/min/1.73 m² – still normal, but early proteinuria and ACR suggest early CKD that may decline.

BMI (29.5)
Overweight/obesity contributes to hypertension, insulin resistance, and renal hyperfiltration.

Lifestyle
• Moderate alcohol (≈1 unit/week). <br>• Physical activity 4.3 h/wk – protective but still low. <br>• Diet quality 6.9/10 – reasonable but room for improvement.

NSAID use
5.8 times/week – chronic NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion and damage.

Anemia
Hb 10.9 g/dL – early sign of declining renal function.

Medications
ACE inhibitor use is protective, but no diuretic or antidiabetic therapy indicates untreated hypertension/diabetes.

Overall interpretationThe combination of uncontrolled glucose, persistent hypertension, significant albuminuria, and a moderate‑to‑high ACR places this patient in a moderate‑high risk category for CKD progression.

Category
Data
Impact on CKD Risk
Age & Gender
53 y, female
Mid‑age; female slightly lower baseline risk than males, but age >50 adds ~10 % risk.
Blood Pressure
139/96 mmHg
Systolic >130 mmHg and diastolic >90 mmHg strongly predict renal damage; contributes ~20 % to score.
Glucose Control
Fasting glucose 176 mg/dL, HbA1c 8.13 %
Indicates pre‑diabetes/diabetes; chronic hyperglycemia accelerates CKD; ~15 % risk weight.
Proteinuria / ACR
3.19 g/day protein, ACR 151 mg/g
Macro‑albuminuria (>300 mg/day) would be >90 % risk; 3.19 g/day is high; ACR >300 mg/g would be severe, but 151 mg/g still indicates moderate nephropathy; ~30 % weight.
GFR
97 mL/min/1.73 m²
Within normal range, but early proteinuria suggests functional decline; moderate weight (~5 %).
Medication & Lifestyle
ACE‑inhibitor (protective), statin, NSAID use ~6×/week (nephrotoxic), high alcohol (~1 unit/wk), moderate physical activity, good sleep
NSAID frequency increases risk; ACE‑I offers some protection. Overall contributes ~5 %.
Family & Past Events
Hypertension family history, past UTIs

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 34 out of 100, indicating a moderate risk. The main points supporting this score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of family kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**: The individual's BMI is slightly elevated (29.87383721952026), which is a risk factor for CKD. However, the absence of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are positives.
3. **Clinical Parameters**: Systolic blood pressure is slightly low (101 mmHg), and diastolic blood pressure is high (104 mmHg), which could indicate potential cardiovascular issues but does not directly point to CKD. Fasting glucose is slightly elevated (112.4839356239316 mg/dL), suggesting prediabetes, which is a risk factor for CKD. HbA1c is within the normal range (4.750442163576614%), which is a positive indicator.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated (1.271106585565828 mg/dL), and GFR is within the normal range (96.47463320911262 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating that kidney function is currently not severely impaired. Protein in urine is somewhat elevated (1.6811506791029929 g/day), and the Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is also elevated (216.92201204844255 mg/g), suggesting some degree of kidney damage or disease.
5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs could have implications for kidney function, but there's no mentioned exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals that could exacerbate CKD risk.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, suggests some impact on daily living but does not directly correlate with a high risk of CKD without other clinical indicators.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical check-ups are somewhat infrequent, medication adherence is good, and health literacy is moderate, which are factors that can influence disease management and prevention.

In summary, while there are both positive and concerning factors, the moderate elevation in blood glucose, proteinuria, and use of certain medications contribute to",34,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 62/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors including demographic characteristics, medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, but the diastolic BP is slightly elevated, which might indicate some cardiovascular stress.
3. **Glucose Levels**: The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are slightly elevated, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: The creatinine level is within the normal range, but the GFR, although within normal limits, is on the lower end for someone without other risk factors. The protein in urine (1.68 g/day) and ACR (216.92 mg/g) are elevated, indicating possible kidney damage or early disease.
5. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but the hemoglobin level is slightly low, which could indicate anemia, a common complication of CKD.
6. **Lipid Profile**: The total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, which can contribute to cardiovascular disease, a major risk factor for CKD.
7. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and statins may indicate management of hypertension and high cholesterol, respectively, but also could be related to conditions that increase CKD risk.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching could be indicative of early CKD symptoms, though nonspecific.
9. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups are infrequent, which could lead to late detection of CKD, but medication adherence and health literacy are good, suggesting a proactive approach to health management.

Overall, while there are several factors that suggest a moderate risk for CKD, such as impaired glucose regulation, elevated protein in urine, and less-than-ideal lipid profiles, the absence of a family history of relevant diseases and some indicators of good health management (e.g., medication adherence) mitigate the risk to some extent.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory tests, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this score are:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 67 years old places you in a higher age bracket, which is a risk factor for CKD. However, your high socioeconomic status may provide better access to healthcare, potentially mitigating some risks.

2. **BMI and Lifestyle**: Your BMI indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for developing CKD. The low level of physical activity (0.53 hours/week) and poor diet quality (2.83/10) further increase the risk.

3. **Medical History and Family History**: The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes is beneficial. However, the presence of previous antidiabetic medication use suggests you may have diabetes or prediabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD.

4. **Blood Pressure**: Your systolic blood pressure (170 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.

5. **Laboratory Tests**: Your fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest good glucose control. However, the elevated creatinine level (1.40 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (60.70 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. The protein in urine (0.26 g/day) and ACR (206.64 mg/g) are also elevated, suggesting kidney damage.

6. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: While your electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, your total cholesterol and triglycerides are elevated, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and indirectly affect kidney health.

7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs frequently (9.12 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function. Symptoms like fatigue (6.35/10) and itching (9.84/10) may indicate underlying issues related to kidney function.

8. **Health Behaviors**: Poor medication adherence (7.59/10), limited health literacy (5.41/10), and infrequent medical checkups (0.49/year) can exacerbate health issues and contribute to a higher risk score.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous conditions such as AKI or UTIs could have contributed to CKD risk if they were present, but in this case, they are not.

2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is significantly elevated at 170 mmHg, which is a major risk factor for CKD as it can damage kidney blood vessels.

3. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR is slightly below the normal range at 60.6985089515265 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating some degree of kidney impairment. The creatinine level is also on the higher side, which can indicate reduced kidney function.

4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.2593521535533 g/day) and an elevated ACR (206.64109922115463 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.

5. **Electrolytes and Metabolic Conditions**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, but the HbA1c is elevated at 8.973723605839776%, suggesting poor blood sugar control, which is a risk factor for CKD.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (31.48320319960003), low physical activity (0.5265575945107992 hours/week), and a relatively poor diet quality (2.8307643925037684/10) contribute to the risk. Alcohol consumption is moderate but within a potentially safe range.

7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs (9.117619976646065 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and symptoms such as significant fatigue and itching may indicate CKD progression.

8. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups (0.4925695742792872/year), mediocre medication adherence (0.7590817324275112/10), and limited health literacy (5.406481445198752/10) can hinder the management of CKD risk factors.

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 67 years old places you in a higher risk category for CKD. However, your high socioeconomic status may provide better access to healthcare, which could mitigate some risks.

2. **Lifestyle Factors**: Your BMI indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. The consumption of 9.21 units of alcohol per week is also a concern, as excessive alcohol consumption can damage kidneys over time. Limited physical activity (0.53 hours/week) and a diet quality score of 2.83/10 further increase your risk.

3. **Medical History and Laboratory Results**: Despite no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, your current health status shows several concerning signs. Your systolic blood pressure is elevated (170 mmHg), indicating hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD. Your fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within or close to the normal range, but the presence of antidiabetic medications suggests you are being managed for diabetes, another key risk factor for CKD. Your creatinine level is slightly elevated (1.40 mg/dL), and your GFR (60.70 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicates impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (0.26 g/day) and an elevated ACR (206.64 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage.

The provided risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: Presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 136 mmHg, which, although not significantly high, is on the higher end and can be a risk factor for CKD if not well-managed.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: Level of 141.00762493198135 mg/dL, indicating impaired fasting glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for diabetes and, by extension, CKD.
4. **HbA1c**: 5.63806670855841%, suggesting impaired glucose control, which is a precursor to diabetes and increases the risk of CKD.
5. **Kidney Function**: GFR of 95.52016930862406 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range but on the lower end, and Creatinine level of 0.9427723897956588 mg/dL. These values indicate that kidney function is currently preserved but requires monitoring.
6. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: 1.562455666434302 g/day, which is a significant risk factor for CKD as it indicates kidney damage.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: High BMI (31.432970628906812), indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD. Although there's no smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, the physical activity level is low (2.660519224393449 hours/week), and diet quality, while relatively good (8.258634210423189/10), could be improved.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Poor adherence to medication (0.506734281101936/10), lower health literacy (3.5885205069717676/10), and poor water quality, which can all negatively impact health outcomes.

- **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
- **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (136 mmHg) increases the risk of developing CKD.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: High fasting glucose (141.00762493198135 mg/dL) and slightly elevated HbA1c (5.63806670855841%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
- **Renal Function**: While the GFR (95.52016930862406 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (1.562455666434302 g/day) and an elevated ACR (67.52002974437306 mg/g) indicate some level of kidney damage or disease.
- **Lifestyle**: Low physical activity (2.660519224393449 hours/week) and a high BMI (31.432970628906812), indicating obesity, both contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score (63.124594479680326/100), suggest that kidney function may be impacting overall health and well-being.
- **Health Behaviors**: Poor medication adherence (0.506734281101936/10) and limited health literacy (3.5885205069717676/10) could hinder effective management of risk factors and disease progression.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several contributing factors:

1. **Family History**: Positive family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure is elevated at 136 mmHg, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (141.00762493198135 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.63806670855841%) levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in urine (1.562455666434302 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 67.52002974437306 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Low physical activity (2.660519224393449 hours/week), poor diet quality (8.258634210423189/10), and high alcohol consumption (19.86772224057338 units/week) contribute to the increased risk.
6. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Low socioeconomic status and poor water quality may also contribute to the increased risk of CKD.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups (3.826216918414957/year) and low medication adherence (0.506734281101936/10) may hinder the management of underlying conditions and increase the risk of CKD.

However, the relatively preserved kidney function (GFR: 95.52016930862406 mL/min/1.73 m²) and absence of previous AKI or UTIs somewhat mitigate the risk. Overall, the combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contributes to a higher risk score for CKD.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 64/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and symptoms. The main points contributing to this high risk score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: High creatinine levels (3.3830184570604835 mg/dL) and a low Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (42.30983991831531 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (1.71273632254545 g/day) is a key marker of kidney damage.
4. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (151 mmHg) can both be a cause and a consequence of CKD, further increasing the risk.
5. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A high fasting glucose level (185.81068035669375 mg/dL) suggests diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, which are major risk factors for CKD.
6. **Symptoms**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score (14.489575351543028/100), indicates significant impact on health and possible advanced kidney disease.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the diet quality is relatively good (6.973145402967294/10) and physical activity is moderate (5.072728444232403 hours/week), the BMI is in the overweight range (28.28714818261262), and alcohol consumption, while moderate, along with NSAIDs use, can have adverse effects on kidney health.

The calculated risk score is based on several key factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points to consider:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor, as hypertension is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 133 mmHg, although not extremely high, is on the higher end of the normal range and, if not managed, could lead to kidney damage over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level of 131.74571499073045 mg/dL and HbA1c of 6.958035436033398% suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing CKD.
4. **Current Kidney Function**: The GFR of 54.47430131762217 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates mildly impaired kidney function. The creatinine level of 4.676799471282694 mg/dL and BUN level of 18.24831474614702 mg/dL also suggest some level of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.6481499508544469 g/day) and an elevated ACR (175.39411773464008 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The relatively low physical activity level (2.52960494457629 hours/week), poor diet quality (1.6858200349761945/10), and poor sleep quality (6.6997227146851/10) can all contribute to the progression of CKD.
7. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (2.868907013672135 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and the poor water quality may also pose a risk.
8. **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups (1.8087118251728311/year), medication adherence (2.739415229000912/10), and health literacy (1.547146588142091/10) are all important for managing and preventing the progression of CKD, but there seems to be room for improvement in these areas.

The provided data indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes is a risk factor for CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **High BMI (37.371730017637994)**: Obesity is a risk factor for developing CKD, as it increases the risk of diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions that can damage the kidneys.
3. **Fasting Glucose Level (110.36217030524617 mg/dL)**: This level is slightly elevated, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can be an early sign of diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **HbA1c Level (7.7338210794087985%)**: This is slightly above the normal range, suggesting impaired glucose control and an increased risk of developing diabetes and subsequently CKD.
5. **Protein in Urine (2.0920232987322507 g/day)** and **ACR (156.58070033733094 mg/g)**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a key indicator of kidney damage and a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Low Physical Activity (0.7782346463716594 hours/week)**: Lack of physical activity is associated with a higher risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Poor Diet Quality (5.920643077549167/10)** and **Poor Water Quality**: These can contribute to a range of health issues, including conditions that affect kidney health.
8. **Use of ACE Inhibitors**: While ACE inhibitors can be protective of kidney function in certain contexts (like diabetes or proteinuria), their use here might also indicate existing kidney issues or hypertension, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
9. **NSAIDs Use (8.11028113305921 times/week)**: Frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be harmful to the kidneys and increase the risk of CKD.

These factors collectively suggest a significant risk for CKD.

2. **High BMI (37.371730017637994)**: Obesity is a risk factor for developing CKD, as it increases the risk of diabetes and hypertension, which are major causes of CKD.
3. **HbA1c Level (7.7338210794087985%)**: This level is near the threshold for diagnosing diabetes, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Elevated Protein in Urine (2.0920232987322507 g/day)**: Proteinuria is a marker of kidney damage and a risk factor for progression of CKD.
5. **ACR (156.58070033733094 mg/g)**: An elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio further supports the presence of kidney damage.
6. **Low Physical Activity (0.7782346463716594 hours/week)** and **Poor Diet Quality (5.920643077549167/10)**: These lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which can lead to CKD.

8. **Poor Water Quality**: This could expose you to unknown substances that might affect kidney health.

However, factors that mitigate this risk include:
- **No previous AKI or UTIs**: Absence of these conditions reduces the risk of CKD.
- **Good Sleep Quality (7.542680129571856/10)**: Adequate sleep can help maintain overall health, potentially reducing the risk of CKD progression.
- **Use of ACE Inhibitors**: These medications can help protect kidney function, especially in the context of diabetes and hypertension.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively high due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease, as diabetes is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **High Blood Pressure**: Although the current blood pressure (122/60 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the use of ACE inhibitors suggests that blood pressure may have been higher in the past, which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (ACR 156.58 mg/g)**: The elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) indicates kidney damage, as it suggests that the kidneys are leaking albumin into the urine, a common sign of kidney problems.
4. **Impaired Fasting Glucose (110.36 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.73%)**: These values indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to the development of kidney disease over time.
5. **Low Health Literacy and Medication Adherence**: Lower scores in health literacy and medication adherence can lead to poor management of existing conditions, potentially worsening kidney health.
6. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially expose the individual to harmful substances that may affect kidney function over time.

However, factors such as no history of kidney disease, no previous AKI, and relatively preserved renal function (GFR of 110.22 mL/min/1.73 m²) somewhat mitigate the risk. Nonetheless, the presence of multiple risk factors contributes to a higher overall risk score for chronic kidney disease.

2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The values of 110.362 mg/dL for fasting glucose and 7.733% for HbA1c indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine (2.092 g/day) and ACR (156.58 mg/g)**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage, and the Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is higher than normal, suggesting kidney stress or early damage.
4. **High BMI (37.3717)**: Obesity is a risk factor for CKD, as it can increase blood pressure and worsen diabetes control, both of which are detrimental to kidney health.
5. **Poor Diet Quality (5.9206/10)** and **Low Physical Activity (0.7782 hours/week)**: A diet low in quality and insufficient physical activity can contribute to obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which increase the risk of CKD.
6. **Use of NSAIDs (8.1103 times/week)**: Frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be harmful to kidney function over time.
7. **Poor Water Quality**: This could potentially expose you to harmful substances that may affect kidney health.

However, some factors are protective or not indicative of high risk, such as:
- **No previous AKI or UTIs**, which are conditions that can directly harm the kidneys.
- **Normal blood pressure (122/60 mmHg)**, which reduces the risk of kidney damage compared to hypertension.
- **Relatively good sleep quality (7.5427/10)**, which is important for overall health, including kidney function.

Given these factors, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and managing weight, is crucial.

Overall assessmentThe patient has a normal eGFR but significant proteinuria and micro‑albuminuria, which are early signs of kidney injury. Combined with obesity, mild hyperglycemia, and frequent NSAID use, the risk for progression to clinically significant CKD is moderate. Hence a 32 / 100 risk score reflects a moderate likelihood of future CKD, warranting close monitoring, lifestyle modification, and possible nephrology referral.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical parameters, and health behaviors. The key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The high levels of protein in urine and abnormal Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) suggest kidney damage, which is a key indicator of CKD.
4. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is high, suggesting potential issues with blood pressure control, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
5. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and antidiabetic medications may indicate the presence of conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, low physical activity, and poor diet quality contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups and moderate medication adherence may hinder timely diagnosis and management of CKD risk factors.
8. **Clinical Parameters**: The levels of creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes, although within certain normal ranges, in the context of other risk factors, contribute to the overall risk assessment.

These factors collectively indicate a significant risk for chronic kidney disease. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized risk assessment and management plan, as this evaluation is based on a snapshot of data and may not capture the full complexity of an individual's health situation.",73,African American,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:
- **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history is a significant risk factor.
- **High Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 4.444197911346851 g/day of protein in the urine indicates kidney damage.
- **Impaired Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 158.70529544298756 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
- **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic BP is at the lower end of the range and diastolic BP is slightly elevated, the use of diuretics indicates an effort to manage blood pressure, suggesting hypertension is a concern.
- **Lipid Profile**: High levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, along with low HDL cholesterol, contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is linked to CKD.
- **Low Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: Poor diet and insufficient physical activity exacerbate the risk of developing CKD.
- **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Both are significant risk factors for a variety of health issues, including kidney disease.

However, the relatively preserved GFR (87.01534950458617 mL/min/1.73 m²) and good sleep quality are positive factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on multiple factors including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, laboratory results, and symptoms. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated, which could indicate potential hypertension issues. However, the given values (92/119 mmHg) suggest a need for clarification or confirmation of the blood pressure status, as the diastolic value seems unusually high compared to the systolic.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (158.70529544298756 mg/dL) and slightly elevated HbA1c (6.035551526406765%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (0.7322548238181792 mg/dL) and GFR (87.01534950458617 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate relatively preserved kidney function but are on the borderline or slightly decreased, which warrants monitoring.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.444197911346851 g/day) with an elevated ACR (203.51319067798372 mg/g) is a significant risk factor for CKD, indicating kidney damage.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and low physical activity level are additional risk factors for CKD.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics, NSAIDs, and antidiabetic medications, along with symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, suggest a complex medical profile that may influence CKD risk.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the actual calculation of the risk score depends on the integration of these factors into a predictive model, which considers the severity and combination of risks. This score of 74/100 indicates a significant risk for CKD, emphasizing the need for regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially more aggressive management of identified risk factors to prevent disease progression.",74,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 68/100

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk.
2. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Elevated fasting glucose (158.71 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.04%) levels are indicative of potential diabetes or prediabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.44 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (203.51 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage.
4. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even though not excessively, can influence kidney function, especially with prolonged use.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the BMI is within a relatively normal range, the high alcohol consumption (19.58 units/week), smoking, low diet quality, and inadequate physical activity (2.51 hours/week) contribute to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which are closely linked to CKD.
6. **Blood Pressure**: The diastolic BP is slightly elevated (119 mmHg), which, although not significantly high, in combination with other factors, contributes to the risk.
7. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR (87.02 mL/min/1.73 m²) is slightly below the average normal range, and the creatinine level (0.73 mg/dL) is within the normal range but on the higher end, indicating potential kidney stress.

However, factors such as good sleep quality, the absence of previous AKI or UTIs, and normal electrolyte levels (except for slightly elevated sodium) somewhat mitigate the risk.

* Family history of hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Elevated systolic blood pressure (125 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (60 mmHg), although within a relatively controlled range, still pose a risk.
* High fasting glucose (124.17090666564704 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.248088718923777%) levels, indicating poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the presence of family history of hypertension and other metabolic factors may still pose a risk.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level of 124.17090666564704 mg/dL and HbA1c of 9.248088718923777% indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **High Creatinine and Protein in Urine**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the presence of 4.428213748256974 g/day of protein in urine suggests kidney damage or disease.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: The potassium level is at the higher end of the normal range, which could be indicative of kidney issues, as the kidneys play a crucial role in potassium balance.
6. **Poor Diet Quality and Physical Inactivity**: A diet quality score of 2.996917658745646/10 and only 2.7517402690258317 hours of physical activity per week may contribute to metabolic syndrome components, increasing CKD risk.
7. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially increase the risk of CKD due to the presence of contaminants harmful to kidney health.
8. **Low Health Literacy and Infrequent Medical Checkups**: Limited health literacy (2.0115687496183/10) and infrequent medical checkups (0.1888492169552185 times per year) may hinder the early detection and management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors. Main points include:
- **Family History**: presence of hypertension and diabetes in the family, which are risk factors for CKD.
- **Blood Pressure**: a systolic BP of 129 mmHg, which is near the higher end of the normal range, indicating potential hypertension.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: elevated at 197.24 mg/dL and 6.03%, respectively, suggesting impaired glucose regulation or diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
- **Kidney Function**: while the GFR is within the normal range at 112.37 mL/min/1.73 m², the presence of protein in the urine (2.90 g/day) and an elevated ACR (292.68 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
- **Medications and Lifestyle**: the use of statins and antidiabetic medications suggests management of risk factors but also indicates their presence. NSAID use could potentially affect kidney function.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: the presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting overall quality of life.
- **Health Behaviors**: regular medical checkups and good medication adherence are positive, but the moderate level of health literacy might impact the ability to fully understand and manage CKD risk factors.

These factors, combined with others, contribute to an increased risk score for chronic kidney disease. Continuous monitoring and management of risk factors, along with adherence to prescribed treatments and lifestyle modifications, are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 70/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as these conditions are major risk factors for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 129 mmHg is slightly elevated, which can increase the risk of kidney damage over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is at the upper limit of the normal range, and the HbA1c is slightly elevated, indicating impaired glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.905 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 292.679 mg/g suggests kidney damage or disease.
5. **Medications**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can increase the risk of kidney damage, especially with long-term use.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the BMI is within the normal range, the physical activity level is relatively low, and the diet quality, while good, is not optimal, which could contribute to an increased risk of CKD.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:

- **Normal Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR is within the normal range, indicating good kidney function.
- **Good Sleep Quality and Overall Health Behaviors**: High sleep quality, adherence to medication, and regular medical check-ups are positive factors.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the absence of severe hypertension, diabetes mellitus diagnosis, and the relatively preserved kidney function (as indicated by GFR) prevent the risk score from being higher. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with lifestyle adjustments (e.g., increased physical activity, optimization of diet quality), are essential to mitigate the risk of progressing to more severe CKD.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 68/100

The provided risk score is based on various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as it can predispose to conditions like diabetic nephropathy, a leading cause of CKD.

2. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The elevated fasting glucose (185.71261460117984 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.960961552468563%) levels indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.

3. **GFR and Creatinine Levels**: The reduced GFR (31.659619643932743 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (1.465530888652066 mg/dL) levels are direct indicators of impaired kidney function.

4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The high levels of protein in urine (4.637829209198273 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR of 207.93269020743668 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.

5. **Blood Pressure**: Although the current blood pressure reading (93/69 mmHg) is not within the typically considered 'high' range for CKD risk, the use of ACE inhibitors suggests a history of hypertension or its treatment, which is relevant for CKD management.

6. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The lower diet quality score (0.8722413884172275/10) and relatively low physical activity (6.737446300480178 hours/week) could contribute to an increased risk of CKD through associations with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medications is appropriate for managing CKD risk factors but also indicates the presence of conditions that necessitate these medications. The suboptimal medication adherence (3.368221863596037/10) and low health literacy (3.0480486996254443/10) could hinder effective management of CKD risk factors.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History of Diabetes**: A family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor for developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (185.71261460117984 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.960961552468563%) are both elevated, indicating poor glucose control, which is a major risk factor for developing CKD.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 31.659619643932743 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, as normal GFR is approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher. This reduction in GFR is a direct indicator of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 4.637829209198273 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: Elevated potassium levels (5.492257962507298 mEq/L) can be associated with kidney dysfunction, as the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, suggests that there is an attempt to manage conditions that can affect kidney function, implying pre-existing kidney issues.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the individual has a higher education level, the socioeconomic status is low, which can impact access to healthcare and management of chronic conditions. The diet quality and physical activity levels are not optimal, which can also contribute to the risk of CKD.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to medication regimens to slow the progression of the disease.",83,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

* Elevated fasting glucose (185.7 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.96%) indicate poor blood sugar control, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly given the family history of diabetes.
* The presence of protein in the urine (4.64 g/day) and high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR 207.9 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
* The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is low (31.7 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
* The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial, but the presence of other risk factors outweighs this protective effect.
* The low health literacy (3.05/10) and suboptimal medication adherence (3.37/10) may hinder effective management of CKD risk factors.
* The patient's socioeconomic status and limited access to regular medical checkups (0.28 times/year) may further exacerbate the risk of CKD progression.

Rationale – Key Risk Drivers
Category
Observed Value
Impact on CKD Risk
Demographics
23 y, female, Black
African‑American ethnicity confers a ~2‑fold higher CKD progression risk, especially in the presence of diabetes.
GFR & Proteinuria
eGFR ≈ 32 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria ≈ 4.6 g/day, ACR ≈ 208 mg/g
Stage 3b CKD with substantial albuminuria is a major predictor of rapid decline.
Metabolic Control
Fasting glucose ≈ 186 mg/dL, HbA1c ≈ 8.0 %
Poor glycemic control accelerates nephron injury.
Medication Use
ACE‑inhibitor (positive), NSAIDs ≈ 7.7 ×/week (negative)
ACE‑inhibitor slows progression, but frequent NSAID exposure increases glomerular injury risk.
Cardiovascular Profile
LDL ≈ 181 mg/dL, HDL ≈ 34 mg/dL, triglycerides ≈ 246 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerotic renal disease.
Lifestyle
BMI ≈ 25, moderate physical activity, moderate diet quality, moderate sleep quality
Suboptimal but not primary drivers; combined with medication adherence ~3.4/10, these factors moderate risk.
Health Behaviors
Low annual check‑ups (~0.28 ×/yr), low health literacy (~3/10)
May delay early interventions and reduce effectiveness of treatment.
Symptoms
Fatigue, nausea, cramps, itching
Common in advanced CKD and reflect ongoing renal dysfunction.
Overall Assessment
The individual has established CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) with heavy proteinuria and diabetes. Frequent NSAID use and poor glycemic control dramatically increase the likelihood of progressive renal loss. The presence of other risk modifiers—African‑American ethnicity and dyslipidemia—further elevates the score. Thus, an 85‑90 % risk rating is justified. A score of 88/100 reflects the convergence of these high‑impact factors, indicating a high probability of CKD progression if current management is not intensified.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 23/100

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided detailed health and lifestyle information. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic BP are within a relatively normal range (111/111 mmHg), which is a positive factor.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels are near the lower end of the ranges (74.53 mg/dL and 7.97%), indicating good glucose control.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: Creatinine (0.77 mg/dL) and GFR (64.08 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest that kidney function is somewhat reduced but not severely impaired. BUN level is within the normal range.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: Levels are slightly elevated (1.39 g/day and 13.46 mg/g), indicating some kidney stress or damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: Levels are within normal ranges, suggesting no acute imbalances or anemia.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A healthy BMI (21.65), no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption (8.74 units/week), regular physical activity (3.43 hours/week), and high diet quality (9.11/10) contribute to a lower risk profile.
8. **Medications**: Use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension or proteinuria, balancing the risk.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of muscle cramps and some fatigue, but overall high QoL score (93.20/100) and good adherence to medication and regular medical checkups.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 23/100 suggests a moderate risk for chronic kidney disease, primarily due to the slightly reduced GFR and presence of protein in the urine, balanced by positive lifestyle factors and managed blood pressure. Regular monitoring and maintenance of healthy lifestyle choices are recommended to mitigate this risk.",23,African American,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 53/100

The risk score of 23/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided data. Here's a brief rationale with main points:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which reduces the risk.
2. **Current Health Status**: 
   - Systolic and diastolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (111/111 mmHg), though on the higher end for diastolic.
   - Fasting glucose is normal (74.53411825284269 mg/dL), and HbA1c (7.974091840668706%) is slightly elevated but not significantly high.
   - Creatinine and BUN levels are within normal ranges, indicating good kidney function.
   - GFR (64.08146240367839 mL/min/1.73 m²) is slightly below the average normal range but not indicative of severe kidney impairment.
3. **Lifestyle Factors**:
   - BMI is normal (21.65395965127941), indicating a healthy weight.
   - The individual does not smoke and has moderate alcohol consumption.
   - Physical activity is somewhat low (3.4341011380001794 hours/week), and diet quality is high (9.110655292738706/10), which are positive factors.
   - Sleep quality is average (7.155705187273635/10).
4. **Medications and Symptoms**:
   - Use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension or other conditions that could impact kidney function.
   - NSAIDs use is occasional, which could pose some risk to kidney function if overused.
   - The presence of some symptoms like muscle cramps and itching could be indicative of electrolyte imbalances or early signs of CKD, but their frequencies/intensities are not severe.
5. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**:
   - No exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals reduces the risk.
   - Good water quality is a positive factor.
   - Regular medical check-ups (3.7386457682115184/year) and moderate medication adherence (3.088595905619748/10) are generally positive, though health literacy is relatively low (1.6843717243082723/10), which could impact self-care and management of health conditions.

Considering these factors,",23,African American,Asian,"Risk Score: 55/100
Rationale – key points
Factor
What the data shows
Impact on CKD risk
Age
42 y
Moderate – age alone adds little to risk but increases cumulative exposure to other factors.
Sex/Ethnicity
Female, Asian
Some ethnic groups (e.g., Asian) have a slightly higher baseline risk for CKD, but gender itself is protective.
Kidney function
eGFR = 64 mL/min/1.73 m²
This places you in CKD stage 3a – a clear indicator of established kidney impairment.
Proteinuria
1.39 g/day
>1 g/day is high proteinuria, strongly associated with progressive renal damage.
Albumin‑creatinine ratio (ACR)
13 mg/g
Mild microalbuminuria; less concerning than the absolute protein amount, but still a marker of renal stress.
Blood pressure
111/111 mmHg
Elevated diastolic component (≥110 mmHg) suggests hypertension‑related kidney strain.
HbA1c
7.97 %
Borderline hyperglycaemia; may signal early diabetic nephropathy if untreated.
Medications
ACE‑inhibitor + diuretic
ACE‑inhibitors are nephro‑protective but also used when kidney disease is suspected; diuretics can affect creatinine handling.
NSAID use
2.4 ×/week
Repeated NSAID exposure can worsen kidney function and proteinuria.
Lifestyle factors
BMI 21.7 (normal), 3.4 h/wk physical activity, 7.2 /10 sleep quality, low smoking/alcohol
Protective elements that help keep overall risk from escalating.
Family history
None of kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes
Absence of a strong familial predisposition slightly lowers baseline risk.
Putting it together
The presence of stage 3a CKD (eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) and high‑grade proteinuria are the most powerful risk determinants, pushing the score upward.
Modifiers such as borderline HbA1c, moderate diastolic hypertension, and frequent NSAID use add further risk.
Protective lifestyle habits and the lack of a strong genetic predisposition moderate the total.
Balancing these elements yields a moderate‑to‑high chronic kidney disease risk of ≈ 55 / 100. Regular monitoring, tighter blood‑pressure control, and limiting NSAID use could help lower this score over time.

The risk score is based on the provided health and medical information. The main points considered for this assessment include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which reduces the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (111/111 mmHg), although the systolic value is on the higher end of normal, it's not indicative of hypertension.
3. **Glucose Levels**: Fasting glucose (74.53 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.97%) are within or close to the normal range, suggesting good glucose control.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: Creatinine (0.77 mg/dL) and GFR (64.08 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate mildly reduced kidney function but not in the stage of chronic kidney disease that would require immediate concern.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in urine (1.39 g/day) and an elevated ACR (13.46 mg/g) suggests some kidney damage or disease.
6. **Electrolytes and Other Labs**: Most electrolytes and other lab values (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, hemoglobin) are within normal ranges, indicating no severe imbalances that could contribute to kidney disease.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may suggest management of hypertension or proteinuria, both of which can be protective of kidney function.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Moderate levels of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a relatively high quality of life score, suggest some impact on daily life but not to a severe degree.
9. **Exposures and Behaviors**: No exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, good water quality, regular medical checkups, and moderate medication adherence contribute to a lower risk profile.

The calculated risk score of 34/100 indicates a moderate risk of chronic kidney disease. This assessment takes into account both the protective factors (e.g., lack of family history, good glucose control, use of protective medications) and risk factors (e.g., mildly reduced kidney function, presence of protein in urine).

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively low, considering the following key points:
- The patient has a relatively healthy lifestyle, with a normal BMI, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, and a high diet quality.
- The patient's family medical history does not indicate a predisposition to kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
- The patient's blood pressure, fasting glucose, and HbA1c levels are within normal or slightly elevated ranges, but not indicative of severe kidney damage.
- The patient's kidney function, as measured by creatinine and GFR, is slightly below the optimal range but not severely impaired.

Brief Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD Risk
Comment
Age (42 y)
Low
CKD risk rises markedly after 60.
BMI (21.6)
Low
Within normal range.
Blood pressure (111/111 mmHg)
Moderate
Diastolic elevation suggests early hypertension, a major CKD driver.
GFR (64 mL/min/1.73 m²)
Moderate
Stage 2 CKD; indicates some loss of filtration.
Albumin‑creatinine ratio (13 mg/g)
Low
Normal (<30 mg/g).
Proteinuria (1.39 g/day)
Moderate
Above 0.3 g/day, signals tubular or glomerular leak.
HbA1c (7.97 %)
Moderate
Pre‑diabetes/diabetes; hyperglycemia accelerates CKD.
Medications
Mixed
ACE inhibitor (protective), diuretic (neutral), NSAID use 2–3×/week (adds risk).
Lifestyle
Low
Good diet, sleep, and activity.
Family history
Low
No renal disease or metabolic disease in family.
Other labs
Low
Electrolytes, lipids, and hematology within range; no acute kidney stress.
Overall assessment:The patient is in the early CKD stage (GFR ~ 64) with a normal ACR but measurable proteinuria and an elevated HbA1c that may herald progression. The modestly high diastolic BP and occasional NSAID use add to the risk, but BMI, diet, and medication (ACEi) help keep the overall risk moderate. Thus a risk score of 30/100 reflects a moderate probability of CKD progression over the next few years.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD, contributes to the elevated risk score.
2. **Hypertension**: The high systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (168/114 mmHg) are indicative of uncontrolled hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Kidney Function**: Although the GFR (89.83 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (3.74 g/day) and a high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR of 199.78 mg/g) suggests kidney damage.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI (32.10), moderate alcohol consumption (14.89 units/week), and relatively low physical activity (4.83 hours/week) may contribute to the risk of developing or progressing CKD.
5. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated fasting glucose (107.84 mg/dL) and high triglycerides (317.24 mg/dL) may indicate metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, especially without the balance of medications like ACE inhibitors which are often protective of kidney function, can impact kidney health. The relatively low adherence to health literacy and fewer medical checkups per year may also hinder optimal management of risk factors.
7. **Exposures**: Poor water quality could potentially expose the individual to harmful substances that might affect kidney function over time.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a significant risk of developing or progressing CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly therapeutic interventions to mitigate these risks.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

* **Family history**: Presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
* **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (168/114 mmHg) increases the risk of kidney damage.
* **Proteinuria**: High levels of protein in urine (3.7437730923809314 g/day) and elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (199.7782321902543 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
* **Reduced kidney function**: Although the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is within the normal range (89.83475287315403 mL/min/1.73 m²), the presence of other risk factors increases the likelihood of progressive kidney disease.
* **Metabolic factors**: Elevated fasting glucose (107.84363771853272 mg/dL) and triglycerides (317.2435296014004 mg/dL) contribute to the risk of CKD.
* **Lifestyle factors**: Poor diet quality (5.7372254836757595/10), low physical activity (4.832486940446246 hours/week), and poor sleep quality (6.246699265230609/10) may exacerbate kidney disease risk.
* **Medications and exposures**: Use of diuretics and NSAIDs may increase kidney risk, while poor water quality may contribute to kidney disease.

However, some factors reduce the risk, such as:
* **No previous AKI**: No history of acute kidney injury, which reduces the risk of CKD.
* **Good medication adherence**: High adherence to medications (4.901807764250322/10) may help manage underlying conditions and reduce CKD risk.
* **High health literacy**: Good understanding of health information (6.7014091155089/10) may facilitate healthy behaviors and disease management.

Major predictor of progression; near the upper limit of moderate albuminuria.
Family history of diabetes & hypertension
Yes
Increases susceptibility to renal injury.
BMI (32.1)
Obese
Contributes to hyperfiltration and later decline.
NSAID use (≈ 5 ×/wk)
Frequent
Adds nephrotoxic burden, especially with proteinuria.
GFR (≈ 90 mL/min/1.73 m²)
Preserved
Current function is normal, but early markers (proteinuria, ACR) point to impending decline.
Other labs
Mildly elevated triglycerides, LDL; normal electrolytes
Modulate overall cardiovascular risk but less direct CKD influence.
Lifestyle
Moderate alcohol, decent activity, good diet score
Slightly mitigates risk, but not enough to offset the above factors.
Combining these indicators, the patient is in a moderate‑to‑high risk category for developing progressive CKD. The score of 70/100 reflects substantial early renal damage (proteinuria, high ACR) and modifiable risk factors (BP, NSAID use, obesity) that would likely accelerate decline if not addressed.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 116 mmHg and diastolic of 69 mmHg, while within a relatively normal range, is on the higher end for optimal kidney health, especially considering the use of ACE inhibitors which suggests a history of or concern for hypertension.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is slightly elevated, and the HbA1c, although within normal limits, suggests a potential for impaired glucose regulation, which can impact kidney health.
4. **Kidney Function (GFR and Creatinine)**: A GFR of 75.83 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range (>90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating some degree of kidney impairment. The creatinine level is also on the higher end of normal.
5. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 121.77 mg/g is elevated, indicating kidney damage and a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is good, the BMI is in the overweight range, and physical activity, although present, may not be sufficient to counterbalance the risk associated with the BMI.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the presence of NSAIDs use could potentially be harmful to kidney function if not carefully managed.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of muscle cramps and itching, which can be related to electrolyte imbalances or kidney dysfunction, adds to the risk profile.

However, positive factors such as good diet quality, absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and good health literacy and medication adherence behaviors help to mitigate the risk to some extent. Overall, the combination of genetic predisposition, clinical indicators of kidney impairment, and lifestyle factors contributes to an elevated risk score for CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

* Family history of diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD
* Elevated fasting glucose levels (115.8 mg/dL), indicating potential prediabetes or diabetes
* Presence of protein in urine (2.3 g/day) and high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (121.8 mg/g), indicating kidney damage
* Use of ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial but also indicate existing kidney issues
* History of taking antidiabetic medications, suggesting existing diabetes or prediabetes
* High BMI (27.57), which increases the risk of developing CKD
* Low physical activity (6.54 hours/week) and relatively low diet quality (7.89/10), which can contribute to kidney disease progression
* Existing kidney function (GFR: 75.83 mL/min/1.73 m²) is slightly below the optimal range, indicating some level of kidney impairment.

However, factors that mitigated the risk score include:
* No family history of kidney disease or hypertension
* No previous AKI or UTIs
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals
* Regular medical checkups (1.04 times/year) and good medication adherence (5.62/10)

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors from the provided information. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (116/69 mmHg) are within a relatively normal range, they are on the higher end, which can still pose a risk for kidney disease, especially if not managed properly.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: The fasting glucose level (115.79638613084644 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, indicating impaired fasting glucose regulation, which can be a precursor to diabetes and increase CKD risk.
4. **HbA1c**: The HbA1c level (4.401421774074743%) is within the normal range but on the higher end, suggesting good glucose control but with room for improvement to minimize CKD risk.
5. **Creatinine and GFR**: The creatinine level (1.0381194804418512 mg/dL) and GFR (75.83261430039428 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate mildly impaired kidney function. A GFR below 90 mL/min/1.73 m² can be an early sign of kidney disease.
6. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.2979257792501446 g/day) with an ACR of 121.76683163074289 mg/g is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for protecting kidney function, especially in the context of diabetes and hypertension.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: While physical activity and diet quality are positives, the BMI (27.57107654997717) indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for CKD. Alcohol consumption is moderate, and there's no smoking, which are positives.
9. **Symptoms and QoL**: The presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a lower QoL score, may indicate early symptoms of CKD or related conditions.

The risk score is calculated based on various factors, including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, and laboratory results. Here's a brief rationale with main points:

**High-Risk Factors:**

1. **Family history of diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease.
2. **Elevated fasting glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 115.8 mg/dL is higher than normal, indicating impaired glucose regulation.
3. **Protein in urine**: The presence of 2.3 g/day of protein in urine is a sign of kidney damage.
4. **ACR**: An Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 121.8 mg/g is higher than normal, indicating kidney damage.
5. **Medications**: Taking ACE inhibitors, statins, and antidiabetic medications may be indicative of underlying conditions that increase the risk of kidney disease.

**Moderate-Risk Factors:**

1. **Age**: At 62 years old, the risk of kidney disease increases with age.
2. **BMI**: A BMI of 27.57 is considered overweight, which increases the risk of kidney disease.
3. **Diet Quality**: A diet quality score of 7.89/10 is relatively good, but room for improvement.
4. **Sleep Quality**: A sleep quality score of 4.42/10 is poor, which can impact kidney health.

**Low-Risk Factors:**

1. **No family history of kidney disease**: Not having a family history of kidney disease reduces the risk.
2. **No previous AKI**: Not having a history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) reduces the risk.
3. **Good water quality**: Having access to good water quality reduces the risk of kidney disease.
4. **Medication adherence**: A high medication adherence score (5.62/10) is beneficial for managing underlying conditions.

Summary:The patient has several red‑flag indicators (elevated proteinuria, decreased GFR, frequent NSAID exposure) that push the chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk above average, but also has protective factors (ACEi therapy, no hypertension, good glycemic control). Taking these into account, a risk estimate of 65 / 100 reflects a moderate‑to‑high likelihood of progressing CKD over the next few years. Monitoring kidney function closely and reducing NSAID use are recommended.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease is 73 out of 100. This assessment is based on several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as it can indicate a genetic predisposition to conditions that may affect kidney health.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 133 mmHg, although not extremely high, is on the higher end of the normal range and can be a risk factor for kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level of 123.46 mg/dL and HbA1c of 5.97% indicate prediabetic conditions, which can increase the risk of developing kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function**: The GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) of 32.69 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of chronic kidney disease.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.39 g/day of protein in urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests that there is an effort to manage conditions (like hypertension and possibly proteinuria) that can impact kidney health, but the presence of these conditions themselves is a risk factor.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI of 39.37 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor for kidney disease. The alcohol consumption and physical activity levels are within moderate ranges but should be optimized for better health outcomes.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, may reflect the impact of kidney disease on daily life and overall health.

These factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Management of blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid profiles, along with lifestyle modifications and adherence to medication, is crucial to slow the progression of the disease. Regular medical check-ups and monitoring of kidney function are also recommended.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: **78/100**

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 123.45805523272227 mg/dL and 5.971212861741689%, respectively, indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Hypertension**: A systolic blood pressure of 133 mmHg is considered elevated, increasing the risk of CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR (32.688285250437715 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: This indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
5. **Proteinuria (3.388507582220706 g/day)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a key indicator of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
6. **Use of ACE Inhibitors and Diuretics**: While these medications can help manage conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, their use also indicates the presence of conditions that increase CKD risk.
7. **Poor Medication Adherence (0.6807689276584783/10)**: Non-adherence to prescribed medications can worsen disease management and increase the risk of CKD progression.
8. **Low Health Literacy (2.1184592857978277/10)**: Limited understanding of health information can lead to poor health behaviors and inadequate management of risk factors.

However, some factors mitigate this risk to some extent, such as:
- **Good Diet Quality (9.387959097528576/10)** and **High Physical Activity (8.954037245582557 hours/week)**, which are protective factors against CKD.
- **No Smoking** and **Moderate Alcohol Consumption (0.6581504596194332 units/week)**, which reduce the risk of CKD compared to smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, considering several key factors:
- **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
- **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the diastolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the systolic blood pressure is elevated (133 mmHg), which can be a risk factor for CKD if not properly managed.
- **Abnormal Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is significantly lower than normal (32.688 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. Elevated creatinine and BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) levels further support kidney dysfunction.
- **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.388507582220706 g/day) and an elevated ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) of 68.02210515697405 mg/g are significant indicators of kidney damage.
- **Electrolyte and Mineral Imbalances**: Although within ranges, the levels of certain electrolytes and minerals (like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus) need to be closely monitored in the context of CKD.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is high and physical activity is significant, the high BMI (39.3669602701779) and relatively low sleep quality (4.819401560219802/10) can negatively impact kidney health.
- **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests management of conditions like hypertension and possible CKD, but NSAIDs use could potentially be harmful to kidney function if not carefully monitored. Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching also point towards potential kidney issues.
- **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups is low (1.5301691066677/year), and medication adherence and health literacy scores are also low, which could hinder effective management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score is based on several key factors that indicate a heightened risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 2.222335336389423 mg/dL is higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.786293875722602 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
3. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 178.53496948400343 mg/g is significantly higher than normal, further indicating kidney damage.
4. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the absence of previous AKI and UTIs is positive. However, the current health metrics are more influential in this risk assessment.
5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient's lifestyle, including smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, relatively low physical activity, and poor diet quality, contributes to the risk. Good sleep quality is a positive factor, but it does not outweigh the negative lifestyle factors.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs and statins, along with occupational chemical exposure and poor water quality, may further increase the risk of kidney damage.
7. **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: The systolic blood pressure is at the higher end of normal, and the fasting glucose level is elevated, which are risk factors for developing kidney disease, especially when considered alongside the already elevated HbA1c level.

Considering these factors, the overall risk score for chronic kidney disease is 73/100, indicating a significant risk that warrants close monitoring and potential intervention to mitigate further kidney damage.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively high due to several factors:

* Elevated fasting glucose (194.5639402768239 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.45282400593852%) levels, indicating poor glucose control, which is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
* High protein in urine (3.786293875722602 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR 178.53496948400343 mg/g), indicating kidney damage.
* Elevated creatinine level (2.222335336389423 mg/dL) and relatively low glomerular filtration rate (GFR 119.09013659360882 mL/min/1.73 m²), suggesting impaired kidney function.
* Family history of kidney disease is absent, but other medical history and lifestyle factors contribute to the risk.
* The patient's lifestyle, including smoking and poor diet quality (2.872998000367648/10), also increases the risk of chronic kidney disease.
* Occupational chemical exposure and poor water quality may further contribute to kidney damage.

However, the patient's high socioeconomic status, higher education, and relatively good sleep quality (9.314324682526664/10) may help mitigate some of the risks. Additionally, the patient is taking statins, which can help manage cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk, a common comorbidity with kidney disease. Nevertheless, the overall risk score is high, indicating a need for close monitoring and potential intervention to slow disease progression.",74,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 68/100
Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD risk
Comment
Age (69 y)
+
Older age is a major risk driver for CKD progression.
Gender / Ethnicity
+
Asian ethnicity has a higher prevalence of albuminuria and faster GFR decline in diabetes.
Diabetes (HbA1c = 7.45 %)
+
Poor glycaemic control strongly accelerates renal damage.
Hypertension (121/99 mmHg)
+
Elevated diastolic pressure, despite a normal systolic value, contributes to nephrosclerosis.
Proteinuria (3.79 g/day, ACR = 178 mg/g)
+
Heavy albuminuria is a key marker of ongoing kidney injury and a predictor of progression.
GFR (≈120 mL/min/1.73 m²)
–
The current GFR is within the normal range, slightly mitigating overall risk, but the high albuminuria suggests early CKD stages.
NSAID use (≈3 × week)
+
Chronic NSAID exposure can precipitate acute kidney injury and worsen existing renal disease.
Lifestyle
–
BMI is normal, sleep quality is good, but smoking status and modest physical activity add small risk.
Medication profile
–
Statin use is protective for vascular health; no ACEi or diuretics limits potential renal protection.
Health behaviors
–
Good medication adherence and frequent medical check‑ups help counterbalance risk.
Symptoms (fatigue, mild nausea, muscle cramps)
+
These are typical of early CKD and may reflect electrolyte or volume shifts.
Overall, the combination of diabetes, hypertension, significant proteinuria, and regular NSAID use places this individual at a moderate‑to‑high risk for CKD progression, despite a currently normal GFR. A score of 68 / 100 reflects this balance between strong risk factors and mitigating factors such as good medication adherence and a normal GFR.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Lifestyle**:
   - **Smoking**: Presence of smoking increases the risk.
   - **Alcohol Consumption**: Alcohol consumption is moderate, which may have a mixed effect on CKD risk.
   - **Physical Activity**: Low physical activity increases the risk.
   - **Diet Quality**: Poor diet quality increases the risk.
   - **Sleep Quality**: High sleep quality may reduce the risk.

3. **Medical History**:
   - **Previous AKI and UTIs**: No previous AKI or UTIs reduce the risk.
   - **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic BP but higher diastolic BP may indicate risk, though systolic BP is within a relatively controlled range.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated levels indicate poor glucose control, increasing the risk of CKD.
   - **Creatinine, BUN, and GFR**: Elevated creatinine and BUN with a relatively preserved GFR may suggest some kidney stress but not severe impairment at this stage.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: High levels are a significant risk factor for CKD.

4. **Electrolytes and Lipids**:
   - Generally within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal to drastically alter the risk score.

5. **Medications**:
   - Use of statins may help in reducing cardiovascular risk, which is beneficial for CKD patients.
   - NSAIDs use can increase CKD risk.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**:
   - Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate some level of kidney dysfunction.
   - Poor QoL score reflects the impact of symptoms and potentially underlying conditions on daily life.

7. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**:
   - Occupational chemical exposure and poor water quality may increase the risk.
   - Low frequency of medical checkups and poor health literacy may worsen outcomes due to potential delays in diagnosis and management.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 suggests a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly preventive or therapeutic",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 43/100

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease is 43 out of 100. This assessment is based on several key factors, including:

1. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 133 mmHg and diastolic of 114 mmHg indicates stage 2 hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for kidney disease.
3. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Fasting glucose of 101.38 mg/dL and HbA1c of 5.72% are slightly elevated, indicating prediabetes, a condition that increases the risk of developing kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: A creatinine level of 0.85 mg/dL and a GFR of 99.66 mL/min/1.73 m² are within normal limits, suggesting good kidney function at present.
5. **Electrolytes and Proteins**: Protein in urine of 4.06 g/day and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 105.29 mg/g indicate proteinuria, a significant risk factor for kidney disease progression.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The presence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and a relatively high BMI, although within the normal range, contribute to the risk.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time. Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate early signs of kidney issues or other related health problems.

The combination of these factors, particularly the presence of hypertension, proteinuria, and lifestyle factors, contributes to the calculated risk score. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose, and kidney function, along with lifestyle modifications (such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, increasing physical activity, and improving diet quality) and adherence to medical recommendations, can help mitigate the risk of progressing to chronic kidney disease.",43,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 34/100
Rationale – Key risk drivers for chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Blood pressure
Systolic 133 mmHg, diastolic 114 mmHg
Elevated diastolic pressure is a strong predictor of progressive kidney damage.
Proteinuria / ACR
4.06 g/day protein, ACR 105 mg/g
Both exceed normal limits; persistent proteinuria is a hallmark of early CKD and correlates with higher progression risk.
Glucose control
Fasting glucose 101 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.72 %
Mild pre‑diabetes; even modest hyperglycaemia can accelerate renal injury when combined with other risk factors.
Smoking
Yes (1.3 times/week NSAID use; 6.1 units alcohol/week)
Tobacco use is independently associated with CKD progression.
Lipid profile
Total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, triglycerides 320 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to vascular injury that can impair renal perfusion.
Demographics & habits
33 years old, female, BMI 20 (healthy), moderate alcohol, adequate physical activity, good diet and sleep quality
These mitigate risk somewhat, but the presence of proteinuria and hypertension outweighs the protective factors.
Renal function
GFR 99.7 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal)
Normal GFR does not preclude early disease if proteinuria is present; it indicates the injury is still in a reversible stage.
Anemia
Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL
Mild anemia may reflect early renal insufficiency and is a known risk marker.
Overall, the combination of elevated diastolic blood pressure, significant proteinuria, pre‑diabetes, smoking, and dyslipidemia places the individual in a moderate risk category for CKD progression, hence the score of 34 / 100. Regular monitoring of kidney function, stricter BP control, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modifications would be advisable to lower this risk.

Adds chronic inflammation and vascular damage risk.
Fasting glucose & HbA1c
101 mg/dL & 5.7 %
Prediabetes‑range, slightly increases renal stress.
Lipid profile
Triglycerides 320 mg/dL, LDL 81 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerotic damage affecting kidneys.
Hemoglobin
10.6 g/dL
Mild anemia may reflect early kidney dysfunction.
Lifestyle & socioeconomic factors
Moderate BMI, good sleep, high health literacy

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including demographic characteristics, medical history, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic (133 mmHg) and diastolic (114 mmHg) blood pressure increases the risk of CKD.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: A fasting glucose of 101.37691113011928 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 5.724144224577129% are within relatively normal limits but on the higher end, which might suggest a potential for developing insulin resistance or diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: A GFR of 99.66202296123532 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (4.055537065068438 g/day) and an elevated ACR (105.28913131521044 mg/g) indicate kidney damage or disease.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. A BMI of 20.19426573599321 is within the normal range, which is protective.
6. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The diet quality is moderate (6.519543449841702/10), and physical activity is high (9.3230568274488 hours/week), both of which are protective factors.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score (25.202268912706295/100), may indicate underlying health issues that could be related to or exacerbate CKD.

Overall, while there are both protective and risk factors present, the elevated blood pressure, presence of proteinuria, and lifestyle factors such as smoking contribute to an increased risk score for CKD.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 73/100

The rationale for this risk score is based on the following key points:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Clinical Parameters**: 
   - **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP/Diastolic BP is 95/80 mmHg, which is within a relatively normal range.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Indicate a risk for impaired glucose regulation but are not in the diabetic range.
   - **Creatinine and GFR**: Elevated creatinine (3.48 mg/dL) and a GFR of 87.72 mL/min/1.73 m² suggest some impairment in kidney function but not severe.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: High levels (4.96 g/day and 80.09 mg/g) indicate significant proteinuria, a key marker for kidney disease.
3. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: 
   - **Potassium** is slightly elevated, which can be concerning for kidney function.
   - **Cholesterol and Triglycerides**: High levels may contribute to vascular disease, also affecting kidney health.
4. **Medications**: Use of diuretics, statins, and antidiabetic medications suggests management of related conditions but may also indicate underlying issues.
5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, and moderate fatigue, along with a relatively low QoL score, indicates significant impact on daily life.
6. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Good water quality, no heavy metals or chemical exposure, regular medical checkups, high medication adherence, and good health literacy are positive factors.

Considering these points, the elevated creatinine, significant proteinuria, and the presence of symptoms suggestive of uremia (like itching) contribute to a higher risk score. However, the absence of a family history of kidney disease, relatively preserved GFR, and good health behaviors mitigate this risk to some extent, resulting in a risk score of 73/100.",73,Asian,Asian,"Risk Score: 65/100

Overall Assessment
The patient has significant proteinuria and a high creatinine level despite a still‑normal eGFR, which signals early-stage kidney injury. The presence of NSAID use and a moderate lipid abnormality further elevate the risk of CKD progression. The blood pressure is well‑controlled, which mitigates some risk. Given these mixed signals, a moderate‑to‑high risk (≈65/100) is appropriate for the current clinical snapshot. Monitoring and early interventions (e.g., reducing NSAIDs, optimizing glycemic control, addressing dyslipidemia) are recommended to prevent progression.

Key points
Proteinuria and ACR are the most concerning markers – levels far above the threshold for CKD stage 1/2 and associated with rapid progression.
Elevated creatinine despite a relatively preserved eGFR suggests early tubular damage or a non‑steady‑state situation.
Medication exposure (NSAIDs, diuretics) and poor dietary habits amplify renal stress.
Low BMI and high fatigue may indicate malnutrition and decreased reserve.
Risk modifiers such as hypertension, diabetes, or family history are absent, slightly mitigating overall risk, but the biochemical evidence of kidney injury remains strong.
Combining these factors, a moderately high risk (≈ 70–80/100) is appropriate, reflecting significant subclinical disease but not yet advanced CKD. Regular follow‑up, lifestyle adjustment, and medication review are essential to lower the trajectory.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and symptoms. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* Elevated creatinine level (3.48 mg/dL) and relatively low GFR (87.72 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (4.96 g/day) and high ACR (80.09 mg/g), suggesting kidney damage.
* History of diuretic use and NSAIDs consumption (3.57 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic.
* Elevated potassium level (5.25 mEq/L), which may indicate a decline in kidney function.
* Presence of symptoms such as fatigue (1.22/10), nausea/vomiting (3.55 times/week), muscle cramps (5.04 times/week), and itching (7.82/10), which can be related to CKD.
* Fair diet quality (0.61/10) and relatively low physical activity (2.54 hours/week), which may contribute to CKD progression.

However, some factors reduce the risk score, such as:
* No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.
* Regular medical checkups (3.31 times/year) and good medication adherence (5.32/10).
* High health literacy (8.40/10), which can facilitate better disease management.

Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Proteinuria
4.96 g/day (nephrotic‑range)
Strongest independent predictor of progressive kidney damage.
Albumin‑to‑Creatinine Ratio (ACR)
80 mg/g
Places patient in the moderate to high albuminuria category (KDIGO A2).
eGFR
87.7 mL/min/1.73 m²
Still in the normal range, but the combination of high albuminuria and normal eGFR indicates early kidney stress.
Electrolyte disturbance
Hyperkalemia (5.25 mEq/L)
Suggests impaired tubular handling, a sign of subclinical dysfunction.
Medications
NSAIDs 3–4 × week, diuretics, statins
NSAIDs and diuretics can precipitate or worsen kidney injury; statins may mask some inflammatory signs.
Blood glucose
113 mg/dL fasting; HbA1c 4.0 %
Pre‑diabetic fasting level but normal HbA1c; glucose alone is not a major driver here.
Blood pressure
95/80 mmHg
Low systolic BP reduces the risk of hypertension‑related CKD but may reflect volume depletion or medication effect.
Lifestyle
Low BMI (16.5) + poor diet quality (0.6/10) + minimal exercise
Malnutrition and poor diet can worsen renal outcomes and limit recovery from injury.
Symptoms
Itching, cramps, mild fatigue
Common in chronic kidney disease; reflect uremic toxin accumulation.
Other labs
Mild anemia (Hb 11.7 g/dL), high LDL (166 mg/dL), high total cholesterol (274 mg/dL)
Contribute to vascular risk and potential nephrotoxicity.
SummaryThe patient presents with nephrotic‑range proteinuria and moderate albuminuria despite a preserved eGFR, placing them at an elevated risk for CKD progression. Additional contributors include medication exposure to NSAIDs and diuretics, mild hyperkalemia, and poor dietary quality. While age, gender, and blood pressure are not strongly adverse, the combination of these factors justifies a moderate‑to‑high risk score of 70/100 for developing chronic kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (170 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated HbA1c (8.0746%)**: Indicates poor glucose control, which can contribute to kidney damage over time.
4. **Reduced GFR (78.635 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: Although within the normal range, it's on the lower end, suggesting some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Proteinuria (3.079769805383719 g/day)**: Presence of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
6. **Medications**: Use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension and possible CKD, but NSAIDs use could potentially exacerbate kidney function.
7. **Symptoms**: Fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of CKD, although they are nonspecific.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: Low socioeconomic status, relatively low physical activity (9.114 hours/week), and moderate diet quality (6.256/10) may contribute to increased risk.

However, factors such as no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, good water quality, and high adherence to medication regimen somewhat mitigate the risk. Regular medical checkups and good health literacy also suggest a proactive approach to health management. Despite these positive factors, the overall risk remains significant due to the presence of key risk factors for CKD.",73,African American,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Hypertension – Systolic BP of 170 mmHg is markedly above normal, a major driver of CKD progression.
Proteinuria & Albuminuria – 3.08 g/day protein and an ACR of 168 mg/g place the patient in a high‑risk category for renal damage.
Reduced GFR – A GFR of 78 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the threshold of 90 mL/min, indicating early chronic kidney disease.
Glycemic control – HbA1c of 8.07 % reflects suboptimal glucose control, accelerating kidney injury.
Prior Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) – History of AKI increases susceptibility to progressive CKD.
NSAID exposure – 4.6 uses per week can further impair renal perfusion, especially in the context of existing hypertension.
Lifestyle factors – Low sleep quality (4.4/10), modest diet quality (6.3/10), and a low BMI (17.9) suggest potential malnutrition or frailty, both associated with CKD decline.
Medication profile – Use of ACE inhibitors is protective, but lack of statins and other cardiovascular‑protective agents, combined with high LDL/low HDL, may contribute to vascular risk.
These combined factors yield a moderate‑to‑high CKD risk score of 78 / 100.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Previous AKI**: A history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) significantly increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 170 mmHg is higher than the normal range, which can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.079769805383719 g/day of protein in the urine indicates kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
4. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) of 168.44536989969566 mg/g**: This is significantly above the normal range, suggesting kidney damage.
5. **Reduced GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) of 78.63503467377174 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Although not severely decreased, it's on the lower end of the normal range, indicating some level of kidney function impairment.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of conditions like hypertension and fluid balance, which are relevant to CKD management.
7. **Symptoms**: Symptoms like itching (pruritus), fatigue, and nausea/vomiting can be associated with CKD, although they are nonspecific and can have other causes.
8. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with the electrolyte imbalances, further support the presence of kidney dysfunction.

Despite the high risk score, factors such as good diet quality, significant physical activity, and high adherence to medication could potentially mitigate some risks if coupled with close monitoring and appropriate management of CKD risk factors. Regular medical check-ups and health literacy also play a crucial role in managing the condition effectively.",74,African American,Asian,"Risk Score: **84/100**

**Brief rationale**

- **Proteinuria & ACR** – 3 g/day and 168 mg/g are strongly predictive of CKD progression.  
- **Reduced eGFR** – 78 mL/min/1.73 m² is already below the normal range and signals early loss of function.  
- **Hypertension** – Systolic 170 mmHg is markedly high, a key driver of kidney damage.  
- **Diabetes indicators** – HbA1c >8% shows poor glycemic control, further accelerating nephropathy.  
- **Prior AKI** – History of acute kidney injury adds to cumulative renal risk.  
- **NSAID use** – >4 times per week increases nephrotoxic exposure.  
- **Other factors** – Low HDL, elevated LDL/triglycerides, underweight BMI, and low sleep quality compound overall cardiovascular and renal risk.  

Combined, these elements place the patient at high risk for progressive CKD, warranting intensified monitoring and therapeutic intervention.",84.0,African American,Asian

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, laboratory results, and lifestyle factors. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Yes, which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Family history: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which is a positive factor.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Elevated creatinine level (1.276 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (78.635 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
	+ Protein in urine (3.079 g/day) and ACR (168.445 mg/g) are elevated, suggesting kidney damage.
* Medications: Use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which can be beneficial for kidney health, but also indicate that you are being treated for conditions that may affect kidney function.
* Lifestyle factors:
	+ Low BMI (17.86) may be a risk factor for CKD.
	+ Moderate physical activity (9.11 hours/week) and relatively good diet quality (6.26/10) are positive factors.
	+ Sleep quality is relatively low (4.43/10), which may negatively impact kidney health.
* Symptoms and Quality of Life: Presence of nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which can be indicative of CKD or other underlying health issues.
* Health behaviors: Good medication adherence (9.53/10) and regular medical check-ups (3.93/year) are positive factors.

Overall, the combination of previous AKI, impaired kidney function, and presence of protein in urine contribute to a higher risk score.

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could lower the risk, other factors contribute to the overall risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures are 127/103 mmHg, which is higher than the ideal range, indicating potential hypertension that can strain the kidneys.
3. **Laboratory Values**:
   - **Creatinine and GFR**: A creatinine level of 0.58 mg/dL and a GFR of 118 mL/min/1.73 m² are within normal ranges, suggesting good kidney function at the moment.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of 3.5 g/day of protein in the urine and an ACR of 207 mg/g indicates kidney damage or disease, as these values are above the normal range.
   - **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within or close to normal ranges. However, high total cholesterol and triglycerides, along with low HDL cholesterol, can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are linked to kidney disease.
4. **Medications and Symptoms**:
   - The use of statins is beneficial for high cholesterol, but NSAIDs, even though used moderately, can potentially harm kidney function over time.
   - Symptoms like edema, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a significant impact on quality of life (QoL Score: 10.6/100), suggest existing kidney issues.
5. **Lifestyle and Exposures**:
   - A high BMI (28.92) increases the risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for kidney disease.
   - Good diet quality and physical activity levels are positives, but the moderate to high alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality can contribute to health issues, including those affecting the kidneys.
   - Occupational chemical exposure is a risk factor for kidney disease.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 reflects a significant risk of chronic kidney disease due to a combination of existing kidney damage indicators (proteinuria), potential risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity), and lifestyle/exposure risks. However, the absence of diabetes,",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 74/100
The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided data:
Family History: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
Lifestyle and Health Factors:
High BMI (28.922014753699145) increases the risk due to its association with hypertension and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
Moderate alcohol consumption (3.372073227650847 units/week) and significant physical activity (9.647525328318306 hours/week) have mixed effects but generally lean towards reducing the risk when considered in isolation.
High diet quality (9.836918584171766/10) is protective, but sleep quality is relatively low (6.401662044486881/10), which could increase the risk due to potential effects on blood pressure and metabolic health.

1. **Family History and Demographics**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, being male and Asian might contribute to a slightly increased risk due to demographic factors.

2. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: 
   - The BMI is on the higher side (28.922014753699145), indicating overweight, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - Alcohol consumption (3.372073227650847 units/week) and physical activity (9.647525328318306 hours/week) are not significantly high or low to drastically influence the risk score in either direction.
   - Diet quality is high (9.836918584171766/10), which is beneficial, but sleep quality is relatively low (6.401662044486881/10), which could negatively impact kidney health.

3. **Medical History and Current Health Status**:
   - No previous AKI, UTIs, or family kidney diseases reduce the risk, but the presence of edema and relatively high levels of protein in urine (3.496616975466784 g/day) with an elevated ACR (207.39214285343448 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney stress or damage.
   - Blood pressure is on the higher side (127/103 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD.
   - The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, indicating good glycemic control, which is beneficial.

4. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - The use of statins could be protective for cardiovascular health but may have varying effects on kidney function depending on the individual and the specific statin used.
   - Occupational chemical exposure is a potential risk factor for kidney damage.

The provided information suggests a moderate to high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key factors contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of certain risk factors in the individual's profile still poses a significant risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 127 mmHg and diastolic of 103 mmHg are elevated, which can be a risk factor for CKD if not managed properly.
3. **Kidney Function**: The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 118.03 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) at 3.496616975466784 g/day is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Electrolytes and Metabolism**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within relatively normal ranges, which is positive. However, the slightly low hemoglobin level could indicate anemia, often associated with CKD.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (28.922014753699145) and less-than-ideal diet quality (9.836918584171766/10, despite being high, indicates room for improvement), along with moderate alcohol consumption and significant use of NSAIDs (3.2299842241091357 times/week), contribute to the risk.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, significant nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a notable level of fatigue, suggests current kidney strain or other underlying issues that could impact kidney health.
7. **Exposures and Behaviors**: Occupational chemical exposure is a risk factor, and while water quality is good, the relatively low frequency of medical check-ups, poor medication adherence, and low health literacy are concerning and could exacerbate any existing conditions or risks.

These factors, combined with the absence of protective factors such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics (which are often used to manage conditions that can lead to CKD), contribute to the elevated risk score. Early intervention, lifestyle modifications, and close monitoring of kidney function are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 60/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

1. **Family History and Medical Background**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of certain symptoms and laboratory findings contribute to the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is slightly elevated (127 mmHg), which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is within the normal range, but the GFR, although within normal limits, is on the higher end, which might indicate hyperfiltration, a potential early sign of kidney stress.
4. **Urine Tests**: The protein in urine (3.496616975466784 g/day) and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) are elevated, suggesting kidney damage or disease.
5. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: The levels of Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, and Phosphorus are within normal ranges, but the Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides are high, which can impact kidney function over time.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, high levels of nausea/vomiting, significant itching, and a compromised quality of life score indicate potential kidney issues affecting overall health.
7. **Exposures and Behaviors**: Occupational chemical exposure is a risk factor for CKD, and the relatively low adherence to medication and health literacy may hinder the management of kidney health.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI and alcohol consumption, although moderate, can also contribute to increased pressure on the kidneys.

Given these factors, while some indicators are within normal limits, the combination of elevated blood pressure, signs of kidney damage (proteinuria), occupational exposure, and lifestyle factors contribute to an increased risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, lifestyle changes (including diet and exercise), and close surveillance of kidney function are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

- The patient has a history of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), which can increase the risk of developing CKD.
- The patient's BMI is high (38.88106920718359), indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD.
- The patient has elevated protein in urine (4.421046012559478 g/day) and a high Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 230.40244159276637 mg/g, both of which are indicators of kidney damage.
- The patient's fasting glucose level is slightly elevated (107.80142404129698 mg/dL), and while the HbA1c is within a relatively normal range, it suggests some level of glucose metabolism impairment, which can impact kidney health over time.
- The presence of high triglycerides (326.73679300368684 mg/dL) and the use of statins indicate lipid metabolism issues, which can also affect kidney function.
- Despite the absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the combination of lifestyle factors (obesity, relatively low physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption) and the presence of UTIs contribute to the elevated risk score.
- The patient's current kidney function, as indicated by the GFR (96.06877195665233 mL/min/1.73 m²), is within the normal range, but the presence of proteinuria suggests kidney damage, which necessitates monitoring and potentially intervention to prevent progression to CKD.",73,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 73/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health conditions. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) is a risk factor.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (38.88106920718359) indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Moderate alcohol consumption (13.977721 units/week) and relatively low physical activity (4.045192467506254 hours/week) also contribute to the risk.
3. **Diet and Sleep Quality**: The diet quality is average (431/10), and sleep quality is below average (5.1732905/10), which can impact overall health and increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Medical History and Current Health**: The history of UTIs and the absence of previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) are noted. Current health indicators such as fasting glucose (107.80142404129698 mg/dL) and HbA1c (4.080201%) are near the upper limit of normal, suggesting a potential risk for developing diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR (96.068771 mL/min/ m²) is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in urine (4.421046012559478 g/day) and a high ACR (230.402441 mg/g) indicate kidney damage or disease.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within normal ranges. However, the total cholesterol (44 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (77.65157 mg/dL), and triglycerides (326.73679300368684 mg/dL) levels, along with the use of statins, suggest a need to manage lipid profiles to reduce cardiovascular risk, which is also relevant to CKD management.

Rationale
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD Risk
Age
81 years
Older age is a major non‑modifiable risk factor; risk increases substantially after 70.
BMI
38.9 (Obese class III)
Obesity contributes to glomerular hyperfiltration, hypertension, and metabolic derangements that accelerate renal damage.
Proteinuria
4.42 g/day (macro‑proteinuria)
Indicates active kidney injury; strongly predicts progression even when eGFR is still normal.
Albumin‑to‑Creatinine Ratio (ACR)
230 mg/g
Falls into the “moderate albuminuria” range (30–300 mg/g) per KDIGO, which elevates progression risk.
eGFR
96 mL/min/1.73 m²
Still normal, but the presence of proteinuria and ACR suggests early damage; a decline is likely if risk factors persist.
Blood pressure
119/68 mmHg
Within normal limits; no hypertensive damage noted.
Glucose/HbA1c
107 mg/dL, 4.99 %
Normal fasting glucose and glycemic control; diabetes not contributing to current risk.
UTIs
History of UTIs
Recurrent urinary tract infections can damage renal tubules and contribute to CKD progression.
NSAID use
~2 times/week
Chronic NSAID exposure can worsen proteinuria and impair renal perfusion.
Lifestyle
Moderate physical activity, decent diet quality, moderate alcohol
Helpful factors that mitigate some risk but not sufficient to offset the high proteinuria.
Overall: The combination of advanced age, extreme obesity, significant proteinuria/ACR, and chronic NSAID use places the individual in a moderate‑to‑high risk bracket for CKD progression, despite a currently preserved eGFR and absence of hypertension or diabetes. A score of 65/100 reflects this intermediate‑to‑high risk profile.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Protein in Urine (4.42 g/day)**: High levels of proteinuria are a significant indicator of kidney damage.
2. **ACR (230.40 mg/g)**: The albumin-to-creatinine ratio is elevated, suggesting kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
3. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, other factors contribute to the overall risk.
4. **Hypertension Indicators**: While blood pressure (119/68 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of proteinuria and elevated ACR suggest potential kidney stress.
5. **BMI (38.88)**: Obesity is a risk factor for developing CKD, as it can increase blood pressure and contribute to metabolic syndrome.
6. **Fasting Glucose (107.80 mg/dL)**: Borderline elevated glucose levels may indicate prediabetes, which can increase the risk of CKD if not managed.
7. **Physical Activity (4.05 hours/week)**: Lower physical activity levels may contribute to a higher risk of chronic diseases, including CKD.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate the risk include:
- **No family history of hypertension or diabetes**.
- **No previous AKI**.
- **Relatively good diet quality (6.30/10)**.
- **Adherence to medication (6.18/10)** and regular medical checkups (3.72/year)**.

The high risk score is primarily due to several key factors:
- Elevated fasting glucose (195.4336129383358 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.309465014150733%) levels, indicating poorly controlled diabetes, which is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- High blood pressure (130/89 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for CKD as it can damage kidneys over time.
- The presence of protein in the urine (2.926489439702416 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR 240.57560421538315 mg/g), which are both indicators of kidney damage.
- Family history, although not mentioned for kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, is less of a contributing factor in this assessment given the direct indicators of kidney stress and damage.
- The patient's lifestyle factors, including smoking and a high BMI (39.67705910014926), contribute to the risk of developing CKD.
- Medications such as ACE inhibitors and diuretics, while used to manage conditions like hypertension and possibly CKD, indicate the presence of conditions that require such management, thus indirectly pointing to an increased risk.
- The elevated creatinine level (2.191401893621568 mg/dL) and slightly reduced GFR (80.64444796992616 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest existing kidney impairment.
- Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., high potassium levels) and high triglycerides also contribute to the risk profile.

* High blood pressure (130/89 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD.
* Presence of protein in urine (2.93 g/day) and high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (240.58 mg/g), indicating kidney damage.
* Elevated creatinine (2.19 mg/dL) and BUN (23.21 mg/dL) levels, suggesting impaired kidney function.
* Low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (80.64 mL/min/1.73 m²), although still within the normal range, is at the lower end.
* The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which may indicate the presence of hypertension and/or kidney disease.
* Poor health behaviors, such as low health literacy (2.05/10) and infrequent medical checkups (0.95 times/year), which may hinder proper disease management.

The patient's risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several factors:
- **Age and Gender**: At 90 years old, age is a significant risk factor. Although being male can also slightly increase the risk, the age factor has a more substantial impact.
- **High BMI**: A BMI of 39.67705910014926 indicates obesity, which is a well-known risk factor for CKD due to its association with diabetes and hypertension.
- **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption (1.3701513468310478 units/week) can exacerbate kidney damage.
- **Family Medical History**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors still places the patient at significant risk.
- **Blood Pressure**: The systolic BP of 130 mmHg is elevated, which can put additional strain on the kidneys.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated levels (195.4336129383358 mg/dL and 7.309465014150733%, respectively) indicate poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
- **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (2.191401893621568 mg/dL) and GFR (80.64444796992616 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (2.926489439702416 g/day) and an elevated ACR (240.57560421538315 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
- **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While some values are within normal ranges, the overall metabolic profile, including high triglycerides, suggests a pro-inflammatory state that can affect kidney health.
- **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension or heart failure, which can be associated with CKD. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching further support the presence of significant kidney impairment.
- **Health Behaviors**: The relatively low frequency of medical checkups and low health literacy could impede optimal management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score is based on several factors that indicate a moderate to high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **HbA1c Level**: An HbA1c level of 9.865967108822382% suggests poor glucose control, which is associated with an increased risk of kidney damage and CKD.
3. **GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 72.32164739620947 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range (which is generally considered to be 90 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher), indicating some level of kidney impairment.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 242.07258591701216 mg/g is elevated, suggesting some degree of kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the individual has a high diet quality and good sleep quality, the physical activity level is relatively low, and alcohol consumption, although within the moderate range, could still pose a risk when combined with other factors.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can pose a risk to kidney health, especially without the protective effects of medications like ACE inhibitors or statins, which are not being used.

However, factors such as the absence of smoking, good water quality, and high socioeconomic status, which can imply better access to healthcare, contribute to a slightly lower risk score. Additionally, the relatively low BMI and absence of previous AKI or UTIs are positive factors. Overall, while there are significant risk factors present, the combination of these factors results in a moderate to high risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring and potential lifestyle adjustments, as well as consideration of medication to manage blood pressure and glucose levels, could help mitigate this risk.",63,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 75/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for developing hypertension yourself, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **HbA1c Level**: An HbA1c of 9.865967108822382% indicates poor glucose control, suggesting either undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, both of which increase the risk of CKD.
3. **GFR**: A GFR of 72.32164739620947 mL/min/1.73 m² is slightly below the normal range (which is typically considered to be 90 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher), indicating some level of kidney impairment.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and an elevated Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) are indicators of kidney damage, a key component of CKD.
5. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time. Additionally, while health literacy and medication adherence are important for managing CKD risk factors, the scores for these areas are not optimal.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 18.019488060814467 is within the normal range, and the absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and good diet quality are positive factors. However, physical activity is on the lower side, which could impact overall health and CKD risk.

Overall, while there are several positive health behaviors and factors (such as no smoking, good diet quality, and absence of certain exposures), the presence of kidney impairment indicators, potential for undiagnosed or pre-diabetic conditions, and family history of hypertension contribute to an elevated risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (such as increasing physical activity), and possibly further medical evaluation and management of blood glucose and blood pressure are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 57/100
Rationale (main points)
Reduced GFR (72 mL/min/1.73 m²) – places the patient in CKD Stage 2, indicating early kidney dysfunction.
High albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (242 mg/g) – micro‑albuminuria is a strong predictor of progression to more advanced CKD.
Elevated HbA1c (≈9.9 %) – signals poor long‑term glycemic control and a substantial risk for diabetic kidney damage, even though fasting glucose is normal.
Frequent NSAID use (≈4 × week) – chronic NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion and accelerate kidney decline.
Low medication adherence (≈3.9/10) – may limit the effectiveness of any future interventions (e.g., ACEi/ARB initiation).
Positive family history of hypertension – adds to baseline risk for renal disease, despite currently normal blood pressure.
Overall healthy lifestyle (good diet, sleep, moderate activity, low smoking) – partially offsets other risk factors, keeping the overall risk moderate rather than high.
These combined factors suggest a moderate but non‑negligible risk for progression of chronic kidney disease, hence the 57 / 100 score.

2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures (95/64 mmHg) are within the normal range, which is beneficial.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose (96.88463291214588 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, and the HbA1c (9.865967108822382%) is high, indicating poor glucose control, which increases the risk of CKD.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (1.659634052910698 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, and the GFR (72.32164739620947 mL/min/1.73 m²) is relatively low, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Electrolytes and Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.0112652716780575 g/day) and an elevated ACR (242.07258591701216 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high diet quality (8.371191251316631/10) and good sleep quality (8.995909013515842/10) are protective factors, while the low physical activity (2.2808886476993937 hours/week) and moderate alcohol consumption (8.071789415302952 units/week) may contribute to the risk.
7. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (4.160042615948969 times/week) may increase the risk of CKD, while the absence of heavy metals and occupational chemical exposure is beneficial.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups (3.617324352028384/year) and good medication adherence (3.868934432277991/10) are positive factors, while the relatively low health literacy (2.3099566946271266/10) may hinder effective self-management.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated HbA1c Levels**: An HbA1c of 9.865967108822382% suggests poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for developing kidney disease, even though there's no reported family history of diabetes.
3. **Borderline Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level of 1.659634052910698 mg/dL and BUN level of 18.673391699372377 mg/dL are slightly elevated, indicating potential kidney function impairment.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: An ACR of 242.07258591701216 mg/g is significantly elevated, suggesting kidney damage, as proteinuria is a sign of kidney disease.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Although electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, the presence of any imbalance can affect kidney function and disease progression.
6. **Medications and NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (4.160042615948969 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and may exacerbate existing kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could have increased the risk, the absence of these does not significantly reduce the risk given the presence of other factors.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (159/110 mmHg) are significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD as high blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (157.85021078261371 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.051646796023526%) are higher than normal, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing CKD.
4. **Creatinine and GFR**: The creatinine level is elevated (2.96091899375722 mg/dL), and despite a GFR of 117.30399370606366 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range, the presence of other risk factors such as high blood pressure and glucose levels suggests potential kidney strain.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The significant presence of protein in the urine (4.809683406961806 g/day) and an elevated ACR (151.3456539802669 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: While most electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the hemoglobin level is slightly below the upper limit of the normal range, which might indicate some degree of anemia, common in CKD patients.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is appropriate for managing conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, indicating an awareness and attempt to manage risk factors. However, symptoms like fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying kidney issues.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high diet quality, good sleep quality, and regular physical activity are positive lifestyle factors. However, the alcohol consumption, although moderate, and a BMI slightly above the normal range could contribute to increased risk.

Given these considerations, the risk score for CKD is elevated,",74,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

**Rationale (main points)**

Her creatinine (2.96 mg/dL) is markedly elevated, but the eGFR (≈117 mL/min/1.73 m²) is paradoxically normal, likely reflecting an early or compensated stage; still, the high creatinine signals significant renal burden.

The rationale for this high risk score is based on the following key factors:
1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressures are high (159/110 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) as it can damage the kidneys over time.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (157.85 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.05%) indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or pre-diabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.81 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 151.35 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage.
4. **Family History and Previous Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and no previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or UTIs, the current clinical presentation is concerning.
5. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for controlling blood pressure and protecting kidney function, but the occasional use of NSAIDs could potentially be harmful to the kidneys.
6. **Electrolytes and Renal Function Tests**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the slightly elevated creatinine (2.96 mg/dL) and the GFR (117.3 mL/min/1.73 m²), although within a range that might not immediately indicate severe kidney dysfunction, should be considered in the context of other risk factors.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a good quality of life score, suggests some impact on daily life but does not fully capture the potential risk of progression to more severe CKD.

Overall, the combination of hypertension, evidence of kidney damage (proteinuria), poor glucose control, and the presence of symptoms suggestive of CKD contribute to the high risk score. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, are crucial to slowing the progression of CKD.",87,Asian,Asian,"Risk Score: 85/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is high, driven by several factors. Main points: 

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: While systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, diastolic blood pressure is elevated, which can be a risk factor for kidney disease.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: Elevated fasting glucose levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function**: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is slightly below the normal range, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant risk factor for kidney disease progression.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: Elevated levels of potassium, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides can also contribute to kidney disease risk.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, along with a history of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, may further increase the risk of kidney disease.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score, may indicate existing kidney disease or other comorbid conditions that could exacerbate kidney disease risk.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 73/100

The provided data indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on several factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are both risk factors for CKD, increases the risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (111 mmHg), the diastolic blood pressure is elevated (107 mmHg), which may indicate a risk factor for kidney disease if not properly managed.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: The level is slightly elevated (160.43340902902673 mg/dL), suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.7456549768341483 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 91.55075154286472 mg/g suggests kidney damage or disease.
5. **Electrolytes and Kidney Function Tests**: The slightly elevated creatinine level and borderline GFR (79.26806238566819 mL/min/1.73 m²) may indicate compromised kidney function.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and relatively low diet quality, despite high physical activity and good sleep quality, contribute to the risk.
7. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, may further increase the risk of CKD.

However, factors reducing the risk include good water quality, no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, regular medical checkups, and a high level of medication adherence. Despite these, the cumulative effect of the risk factors puts the individual at a significant risk for CKD, necessitating close monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and lifestyle adjustments to mitigate the risk.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated, which may indicate potential issues with blood pressure management.
3. **Fasting Glucose**: The elevated fasting glucose level suggests impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) are direct indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The slightly elevated potassium level could indicate impaired kidney function, as the kidneys play a critical role in electrolyte balance.
6. **Medications**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, especially with frequent use, contributes to the risk.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the physical activity level is high and sleep quality is good, the low BMI and history of smoking are negative factors. The diet quality, while moderate, could be improved to help manage or reduce the risk of CKD.

These factors cumulatively contribute to an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (including dietary improvements, smoking cessation, and managing blood pressure and glucose levels), and careful management of medications are recommended to mitigate this risk.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

* Family history of kidney disease is absent, but the presence of other risk factors compensates for this.
* The patient's age (80 years) and BMI (17.460867726124743) are also considered, as older age and lower BMI can be associated with higher risk of kidney disease.
* The patient's lifestyle, including smoking and moderate alcohol consumption, may also contribute to the risk.
* Laboratory results such as elevated BUN (30.18348609290292 mg/dL) and electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium) further support the risk assessment.
* The patient's medication regimen, including ACE inhibitors, may be indicative of existing kidney disease management.
* Symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching also align with chronic kidney disease.
* The patient's relatively low health literacy (3.5530792341529205/10) and medication adherence (1.40277963982685/10) may hinder effective disease management, increasing the risk score.",73,Asian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 85/100
Rationale (key contributors to the score)
Age (80 y) – Advanced age is a strong independent risk factor for CKD progression.
Reduced eGFR (42.97 mL/min/1.73 m²) – Indicates stage 3b CKD; lower eGFR correlates with higher progression risk.
Marked proteinuria (2.85 g/day) – Heavy proteinuria is a major predictor of rapid kidney function loss.
NSAID use (≈10 × week) – Chronic NSAID exposure aggravates renal perfusion and accelerates decline.
Smoking – Adds to vascular damage and worsens CKD prognosis.
Low BMI (~17.5) – Possible malnutrition or sarcopenia, which can worsen outcomes.
Medication adherence (1.4/10) – Poor adherence limits the effectiveness of renoprotective drugs (e.g., ACE‑inhibitor).
Limited health literacy (3.5/10) – May impede self‑management and adherence to lifestyle recommendations.
Overall, these factors combine to yield a high probability of CKD progression, hence the elevated risk score.

2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (2.845997760694858 g/day) and an elevated ACR (27.646025160250876 mg/g) are markers of kidney damage.
3. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and no previous AKI or UTIs, the current kidney function indicators are concerning.
4. **Lifestyle Factors**: A low BMI (17.460867726124743) could indicate malnutrition, which might affect kidney health. Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption (3.778501336782491 units/week) are also risk factors.
5. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management but also indicates the presence of a condition requiring such medication. Frequent muscle cramps (4.904027223207211 times/week) and some level of fatigue (2.571611963463355/10) and itching (1.8518994664996091/10) could be related to CKD.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups (3.17973001386667 times/year) are a positive factor, but medication adherence (1.40277963982685/10) and health literacy (3.5530792341529205/10) could be improved to better manage CKD risk factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk.
2. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated creatinine levels (4.319144668533839 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (66.55520687234 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. Additionally, the presence of significant protein in the urine (3.127367267083032 g/day) with a high ACR (248.07749578052096 mg/g) suggests kidney damage.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: High fasting glucose (146.22582081726807 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.481188266807226%) levels indicate poor glycemic control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Hypertension**: Although the current blood pressure (116/85 mmHg) is relatively controlled, the presence of kidney disease may indicate previous or underlying hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (7.1166546686258725 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with pre-existing kidney issues. Poor water quality may also contribute to the risk.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Low frequencies of medical checkups (0.5643865822331562/year) and poor health literacy (0.2839882207196309/10) may hinder timely diagnosis and management of CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could potentially lower the risk, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) indicates some level of kidney stress.
2. **Clinical Measurements**:
   - **Fasting Glucose**: Elevated at 190.6468281289432 mg/dL, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - **HbA1c**: Slightly elevated at 4.448995810704802%, indicating some level of glucose dysregulation.
   - **Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Within normal ranges but on the higher end, suggesting potential kidney stress.
   - **GFR**: At 63.8467013580013 mL/min/1.73 m², it's lower than the ideal range (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating some level of kidney function impairment.
   - **Protein in Urine and ACR**: Elevated, indicating kidney damage.
3. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: While mostly within normal ranges, the high triglycerides level could indicate metabolic syndrome, a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors suggests management of conditions like hypertension or proteinuria, which are risk factors for CKD.
5. **Symptoms and QoL**: The presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, itching, and a relatively low QoL score could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and well-being.
6. **Health Behaviors**: Good adherence to medication and high health literacy are positive factors, but the frequency of medical checkups could be improved for better monitoring and management of potential CKD.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (such as diet and physical activity), and adherence to prescribed medications to mitigate this risk.

Rationale
Key factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Estimated GFR (eGFR)
63 mL/min/1.73 m²
Stage 3 CKD; moderate loss of kidney function increases long‑term risk.
Proteinuria
4.7 g/day (high) & ACR 130 mg/g
Persistent protein excretion ≥4 g/day is a strong predictor of progression to kidney failure.
Blood pressure
90/66 mmHg (low)
Unusually low BP suggests compensated hypertension or fluid shifts; not a direct risk factor here.
Diabetes markers
Fasting glucose 190 mg/dL (elevated), HbA1c 4.45 % (normal)
Hyperglycemia points to intermittent hyperglycemic episodes, but low HbA1c and absence of antidiabetic meds mitigate chronic diabetes risk.
Urinary tract infections
History of UTIs
Recurrent UTIs can worsen renal function, especially with proteinuria.
Medication
ACE inhibitor use
Protective in CKD but also a marker of known kidney disease or hypertension.
Lifestyle
BMI 19 (lean), alcohol 16 u/w, moderate physical activity
Generally favorable; low BMI may reduce metabolic strain but does not offset proteinuria.
Lipid profile
TG 327 mg/dL
Hypertriglyceridemia can contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is a comorbidity of CKD.
Symptoms
Fatigue 3.6/10, nausea/vomiting 0.87 ×/week, muscle cramps 5.2 ×/week, itching 6.3/10
Indicative of early uremic changes and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.
Health behaviors
High medication adherence (9.2/10), frequent check‑ups (≈2/year)
These factors help contain progression but do not negate existing renal damage.
Overall assessment:The patient has moderate‑to‑severe proteinuria and a reduced eGFR—the most powerful predictors of CKD progression.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, current health status, and behaviors. For this individual, several key factors contribute to the high risk score:

1. **Age and Gender**: Being 81 years old (male) places this individual in a higher risk category for CKD due to the natural decline in kidney function that occurs with aging and the generally higher incidence of CKD in males.

2. **Medical History**: A history of UTIs (urinary tract infections) can increase the risk of developing CKD, as recurrent infections can cause kidney damage over time.

3. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 159 mmHg is higher than the recommended level, which can increase the risk of kidney damage and CKD. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for CKD as it can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time.

4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Although the HbA1c level is within a relatively normal range, the fasting glucose level of 145.34855741788638 mg/dL suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can be a risk factor for CKD. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD, and impaired glucose regulation can contribute to kidney damage.

5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 4.196118952479978 mg/dL, indicating some level of kidney impairment. The GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) of 87.27860445951873 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal range, when considered alongside other factors, contributes to the overall risk assessment. The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) at 3.853142977036277 g/day is a significant indicator of kidney damage.

6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for protecting kidney function, especially in the context of high blood pressure and proteinuria. However, the use of NSAIDs, even at a frequency of 6.2459780096618935 times/week, can be harmful to kidney function and contribute to CKD risk.

7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting the quality",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100

The calculated risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered in this assessment include:

1. **Family History and Medical Background**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes is positive. However, the presence of previous UTIs (urinary tract infections) can be a risk factor for CKD, as they can cause kidney damage over time if not properly managed.

2. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 24.0442501443245 is within the normal range, which is beneficial. However, smoking and alcohol consumption (1.6063289589049012 units/week) are risk factors for CKD. The physical activity level (3.061486509185748 hours/week) could be improved, as regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of CKD. Diet quality (7.964356443506597/10) and sleep quality (8.118465289738781/10) are relatively good, which can help mitigate CKD risk.

3. **Clinical Parameters**: The systolic blood pressure (159 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Fasting glucose (145.34855741788638 mg/dL) and HbA1c (4.935784115309774%) levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, suggesting a risk of developing diabetes, a major cause of CKD. The creatinine level (4.196118952479978 mg/dL) and BUN level (36.41733665616448 mg/dL) are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. The GFR (87.27860445951873 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range but on the lower end, considering the overall clinical context. Proteinuria (3.853142977036277 g/day) and a high ACR (97.71678694994958 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage.

4. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges. The total cholesterol (289.96120002597434 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (75.84301075882234 mg/dL), and triglycerides (345.4703467802684 mg/dL) levels suggest a need for lipid management to reduce cardiovascular risk",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 88/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: Being 81 years old and of Hispanic ethnicity, with a middle socioeconomic status, may contribute to a higher risk due to potential barriers in healthcare access and lifestyle factors.
* **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, although the amount of alcohol consumption is relatively low, and moderate physical activity may contribute to the risk. The diet quality is good, and sleep quality is high, which are positive factors.
* **Medical History**: The presence of UTIs and the use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidney function, increase the risk. The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes is a positive factor.
* **Clinical Measurements**: Elevated systolic blood pressure, high fasting glucose, and elevated creatinine levels are significant risk factors for CKD. The GFR is within the normal range, but the presence of protein in urine (proteinuria) is a critical indicator of kidney damage.
* **Health Behaviors**: The low frequency of medical checkups, poor medication adherence, and limited health literacy are factors that can exacerbate the condition by delaying diagnosis and complicating management.
* **Electrolytes and Lipids**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within normal limits, which is positive. However, high total cholesterol and triglycerides may indirectly contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is linked to CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is high due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing kidney disease, as diabetes is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The high fasting glucose (186.88596787509044 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.670214410501709%) levels indicate poor blood sugar control, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Reduced GFR**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 48.54493231920969 mL/min/1.73 m² is lower than normal, indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.5171942366513576 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 142.2077504183003 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension**: Although the blood pressure (120/89 mmHg) is not severely elevated, it is still a risk factor for CKD, especially in combination with other factors.
6. **Obesity**: A BMI of 34.28972161169535 increases the risk of developing CKD, as excess weight can put extra pressure on the kidneys.

These factors combined indicate a high risk of chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of blood sugar, blood pressure, and kidney function, as well as lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight loss, increased physical activity, and improved diet quality), are essential to slow disease progression.",83,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

The high risk score is primarily due to several significant factors:
- **Family history of diabetes**: This is a known risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
- **High fasting glucose and HbA1c levels**: Indicative of poorly controlled diabetes, which can directly damage kidney function over time.
- **Elevated creatinine and decreased GFR**: These are direct indicators of impaired kidney function. A GFR of 48.54493231920969 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range, suggesting kidney damage.
- **Protein in urine (proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a key marker of kidney damage, and the ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) is significantly elevated, further supporting kidney disease.
- **High blood pressure**: Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are within a relatively controlled range, hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, and management of blood pressure is crucial to prevent further kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle factors**: While physical activity and sleep quality are favorable, the high BMI and less-than-ideal diet quality can contribute to the risk of developing or exacerbating CKD.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue, and other symptoms suggest that kidney function is compromised, affecting overall health and quality of life.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Here are the main points contributing to this risk score:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Laboratory Results**: 
   - **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.1054063446712785 mg/dL suggests impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.
   - **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.5298909902761273 g/day) indicates kidney damage, a key feature of CKD.
   - **ACR (Albumin to Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 167.3440061445214 mg/g is elevated, indicating significant proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney damage.
3. **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 128 mmHg is slightly elevated, which can contribute to kidney disease progression over time.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Although not extremely high, the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to the development or progression of CKD.
5. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The slightly elevated potassium level (5.375943879099672 mEq/L) and low hemoglobin (10.688132340296082 g/dL) might indicate some level of kidney dysfunction affecting electrolyte balance and erythropoietin production.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and exposure to occupational chemicals could potentially impact kidney function, though the effect would depend on the specific context and duration of exposure.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Limited medical checkups, poor medication adherence, and moderate health literacy might hinder timely diagnosis and optimal management of CKD, potentially increasing the risk.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 73/100 reflects a significant risk of CKD, primarily driven by indicators of kidney damage and dysfunction, along with lifestyle and behavioral factors that could exacerbate the condition.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 66/100

The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily based on several key factors from the provided medical history and lifestyle information. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor, as it may predispose to higher blood pressure, a major contributor to CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic BP of 128 mmHg, although not drastically high, is on the higher end of normal and, if not managed, could exacerbate kidney function over time.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level of 99.2262022766305 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.76376207544753% indicate impaired glucose regulation, suggesting prediabetes or early diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **GFR and Creatinine Levels**: A GFR of 77.001611051462 mL/min/1.73 m² and creatinine level of 4.1054063446712785 mg/dL suggest slightly impaired kidney function, which, while not indicative of severe CKD, is a critical indicator of the kidneys' filtering capability.
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.5298909902761273 g/day) with an ACR of 167.3440061445214 mg/g is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
6. **Use of Diuretics and NSAIDs**: The use of these medications, especially NSAIDs (4.856463969510424 times/week), can be harmful to kidney function if not monitored closely.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: A diet quality score of 2.1147228130587923/10 and moderate alcohol consumption (18.97871750003008 units/week) may contribute to an increased risk of CKD due to potential nutritional deficiencies and alcohol's adverse effects on the kidneys.

However, factors mitigating this risk include the absence of smoking, a relatively healthy BMI (23.25769218892196), and engagement in physical activity (5.370090856825554 hours/week).

The calculated risk score indicates a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 128 mmHg, although not extremely high, is on the higher end of the normal range and contributes to the risk, especially in the context of other factors.
3. **High HbA1c Levels**: An HbA1c level of 8.76376207544753% indicates poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for developing kidney disease.
4. **Elevated Creatinine and Urea Levels**: The creatinine level is at the higher end of the normal range, and the BUN level, while within normal limits, along with the creatinine, suggests some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.5298909902761273 g/day) is a key indicator of kidney damage and a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Medication and Lifestyle Factors**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even though NSAIDs are used at a moderate frequency, can impact kidney function over time. The diet quality and physical activity levels are also not optimal, which could contribute to the overall risk.
7. **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a relatively low quality of life score, may indicate some level of kidney dysfunction impacting daily life.

Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD risk
Evidence from profile
Renal function
Elevated creatinine (4.1 mg/dL) and reduced eGFR (≈77 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate existing kidney injury.
Severe proteinuria (0.53 g/day) and ACR 167 mg/g further support renal damage.
Blood pressure / family history
Hypertensive family history increases susceptibility to glomerular injury.
Systolic 128 mmHg, diastolic 65 mmHg – still within range but could worsen with ongoing exposure.
Medication and exposures
Frequent NSAID use (≈5 × week) and diuretics elevate risk of acute interstitial nephritis and volume depletion.
Occupational chemical exposure adds another insult.
Metabolic profile
Poor glucose control (HbA1c 8.8 %) predisposes to diabetic nephropathy. Hyperlipidemia (TC 262 mg/dL, TG 324 mg/dL) can accelerate atherosclerotic renal disease.

Lifestyle
Low diet quality (2.1/10), moderate alcohol (≈19 units/wk), and sub‑optimal sleep (4/10) contribute to overall metabolic stress.

Anemia & electrolyte
Hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL and potassium 5.4 mEq/L reflect chronic kidney stress and impaired excretion.

Health behavior
Low adherence (1.5/10) and infrequent check‑ups (0.35/year) hinder early intervention.

The combined effect of impaired filtration, significant proteinuria, high HbA1c, medication‐related nephrotoxicity, and poor health behaviors yields a moderate‑to‑high risk of CKD progression.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

- **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 171 mmHg and diastolic BP of 99 mmHg are above the normal range, indicating hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
- **Impaired Glucose Regulation**: Fasting glucose of 183.47 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.33% suggest impaired glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
- **Reduced Kidney Function**: A GFR of 20.45 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly lower than the normal range, indicating compromised kidney function.
- **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.673 g/day) and an elevated ACR (192.97 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
- **Family History and Other Factors**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's age, high BMI, and low diet quality contribute to the risk.
- **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the frequent use of NSAIDs could potentially worsen kidney function.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
- **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient has indicators of potential kidney strain, such as previous AKI not being explicitly denied in the context but mentioned as ""No previous AKI,"" which might suggest some kidney issues in the past.
- **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: The patient has elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (171/99 mmHg) and high fasting glucose (183.4743107326833 mg/dL), which are significant risk factors for CKD.
- **Kidney Function Tests**: The patient's GFR (20.451881643691053 mL/min/1.73 m²) is low, indicating impaired kidney function. The creatinine level (1.3048550817244446 mg/dL) and BUN level (48.177806463419586 mg/dL) are also elevated, suggesting kidney stress.
- **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.6733483813957425 g/day) and an elevated ACR (192.96930079829 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: While the patient does not smoke and has good sleep quality, the high BMI (34.53142384457131), low diet quality (1.3315312895629994/10), and moderate alcohol consumption (13.666725625604276 units/week) contribute to the risk.
- **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a decreased QoL score (68.21927355252346/100), indicates a significant impact of kidney disease on the patient's health and well-being.
- **Health Behaviors**: While medication adherence is good (7.910548298916123/10), the frequency of medical checkups (1.112924749746481/year) could be improved to better manage CKD risk factors.

The provided patient data indicates a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The rationale for this assessment is based on several key factors:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (171/99 mmHg) is higher than the recommended levels, which is a significant risk factor for CKD as it can damage kidney blood vessels.

2. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (183.4743107326833 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.330222183341963%) are elevated, indicating poor glucose control, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD.

3. **Reduced Kidney Function**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 20.451881643691053 mL/min/1.73 m², which is below the normal range (60 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher), indicating impaired kidney function.

4. **Presence of Protein in Urine**: The Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is 192.96930079829 mg/g, which is higher than normal, signifying kidney damage.

5. **Family History and Other Medical Conditions**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes mentioned, the patient's current health status (obesity, high blood pressure, and impaired glucose regulation) poses significant risks.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's high BMI (34.53142384457131), low diet quality (1.3315312895629994/10), and moderate alcohol consumption (13.666725625604276 units/week) can contribute to the progression of CKD.

7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for blood pressure control and kidney protection, but the occasional use of NSAIDs (6.9565221574140494 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and should be monitored.

Given these factors, the patient is at a high risk for CKD progression or development, highlighting the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to the prescribed treatment plan to manage risk factors and slow disease progression.",83,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 85/100
Rationale – key risk contributors
Factor
Clinical impact on CKD risk
Notes
Age (85 y)
↑Risk
Age > 80 is a major independent risk factor for CKD progression.
GFR (20 mL/min/1.73 m²)
Stage 3b CKD; very high risk of further decline
Low eGFR alone would place the patient in a high‑risk category.
Proteinuria (0.67 g/day) & ACR (193 mg/g)
Markers of kidney damage
Values above the normal range strongly predict progression.
Hypertension (171/99 mmHg)
Chronic high BP accelerates CKD
Despite ACE‑inhibitor therapy, systolic BP remains uncontrolled.
Hyperglycemia (Fasting glucose 183 mg/dL, HbA1c 7.3 %)
Undiagnosed or sub‑optimal diabetes control
Both metrics exceed normal limits, contributing to renal stress.
BMI (34.5)
Obesity adds glomerular hyperfiltration and inflammation
Obesity-related nephropathy is a recognized risk factor.
NSAID use (≈7×/week)
Potential for recurrent acute kidney injury
Repetitive exposure can worsen chronic injury.
Lipid profile (LDL 133, HDL 29)
Atherogenic milieu → vascular damage
Dyslipidemia can accelerate nephro‑vascular disease.
Lifestyle factors
Sleep quality good, no smoking, moderate alcohol, some activity
These mitigate risk somewhat but are outweighed by the above.
Overall, the combination of advanced age, markedly reduced eGFR, significant proteinuria, uncontrolled hypertension, and evidence of early glucose dysregulation places the patient in a high‑risk category for CKD progression.

The risk score is high due to several factors:

* Elevated fasting glucose (183.4743107326833 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.330222183341963%) levels, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.
* High blood pressure (171/99 mmHg) which is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
* Elevated creatinine (1.3048550817244446 mg/dL) and BUN (48.177806463419586 mg/dL) levels, indicating impaired kidney function.
* Low GFR (20.451881643691053 mL/min/1.73 m²), which is a direct indicator of kidney function and is significantly below the normal range.
* Presence of protein in urine (0.6733483813957425 g/day) and high ACR (192.96930079829 mg/g), indicating kidney damage.
* History of taking ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial but also requires careful monitoring of kidney function.
* The patient's BMI (34.53142384457131) is classified as obese, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease.

However, some factors that may mitigate the risk include:
* No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
* Good sleep quality (9.243542076315464/10) and relatively high health literacy (6.259616308657731/10).
* The patient has a relatively high medication adherence score (7.910548298916123/10), which is important for managing underlying conditions.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here's a brief rationale with main points:

1. **High Creatinine and Low GFR**: The creatinine level is elevated at 2.8599225550386067 mg/dL, and the GFR is decreased at 43.50366704834624 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.402226192500894 g/day) and an elevated ACR (148.13217617059672 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
3. **Hypertension**: Although the systolic BP (125 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP (106 mmHg) is elevated, which can contribute to CKD progression.
4. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is high (152.35356373890215 mg/dL), and the HbA1c is slightly elevated (6.423730260922633%), indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Family and Medical History**: The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk, but the presence of previous factors outweighs this.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI (37.85391154133752), moderate alcohol consumption (10.051339535787951 units/week), and relatively low diet quality (2.9005071229577517/10) contribute to the increased risk.
7. **Occupational Chemical Exposure and Poor Water Quality**: These environmental exposures may further increase the risk of CKD.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score (19.04758351042609/100), may indicate advanced kidney disease.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 83/100 indicates a high risk of chronic kidney disease. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and to develop a personalized plan to manage and mitigate these risks.",83,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 75/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.8599225550386067 mg/dL and a GFR of 43.50366704834624 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR is significantly below the normal range, suggesting a considerable loss of kidney function.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 2.402226192500894 g/day of protein in the urine and an Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 148.13217617059672 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.

3. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic blood pressure is at the higher end of the normal range (125 mmHg), the diastolic blood pressure is elevated (106 mmHg), which is a risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can both cause and be a result of kidney disease.

4. **Family and Medical History**: While there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the absence of previous AKI and UTIs does not significantly mitigate the current indicators of kidney dysfunction.

5. **Lifestyle and Exposures**: The patient's high BMI (37.85391154133752), which falls into the obese category, increases the risk for CKD. The dietary quality score of 2.9005071229577517/10 suggests a poor diet, which can contribute to kidney disease risk. Although physical activity is relatively high, the overall lifestyle factors, including diet, contribute to the risk. Exposure to occupational chemicals and poor water quality may also pose additional risks to kidney health.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as significant fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, and a low QoL score indicate the presence of significant morbidity, which could be related to CKD.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs could potentially be harmful to kidney function, especially with frequent use (7.804773305713535 times/week). Good medication adherence and relatively frequent medical checkups are positive behaviors but do not offset the risk posed by other factors.",83,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Abnormal Kidney Function Tests**: The patient has elevated creatinine levels (3.5996509468794025 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (33.54079211139371 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. The presence of significant proteinuria (4.446266214674358 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 202.51022243120673 mg/g further supports kidney damage.

2. **Family History of Hypertension**: While the patient's current blood pressure (114/70 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the family history of hypertension is a risk factor for developing CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can lead to kidney damage over time.

3. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's high BMI (32.45681483826366) and smoking habit are risk factors for CKD. Smoking can reduce kidney function and exacerbate existing kidney disease, while obesity can increase the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which are major risk factors for CKD.

4. **High Fasting Glucose**: The patient's fasting glucose level (195.02571513986635 mg/dL) suggests an impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing diabetes, a leading cause of CKD.

5. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, while beneficial for managing conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, also indicates that the patient is being treated for conditions that can impact kidney health.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, high levels of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a significantly impaired quality of life (QoL Score: 2.8280089355379845/100), are consistent with advanced CKD, which typically presents with a multitude of systemic symptoms due to the build-up of toxins.

7. **Health Behaviors**: Low adherence to medication (0.2228361523591426/10) and infrequent medical check-ups (0.0327151863715111 times/year) could exacerbate the progression of CKD due to potential lapses in managing underlying conditions and monitoring kidney health.

Smoking adds oxidative stress and vascular damage; family history elevates baseline risk.
Electrolyte & mineral balance
Potassium 4.48 mEq/L, phosphorus 3.47 mg/dL
Mild disturbances suggest early CKD complications.
Symptoms & QoL
Edema, fatigue 9/10, muscle cramps, itching, QoL 2.8/100
These reflect advanced renal insufficiency and systemic complications.
Lifestyle & comorbidities
BMI 32.5 (obesity), 18.6 alcohol units/week, 8.5 h/wk activity, diet 9.3/10, sleep 7.9/10
Obesity and moderate alcohol may worsen metabolic syndrome; otherwise physical activity and diet are relatively good.
Medication adherence

No additional environmental risk factors.
Summary
The combination of a markedly reduced eGFR, significant proteinuria, and a high albumin‑creatinine ratio places the individual in a high‑risk category for progressive CKD. Lifestyle factors (smoking, obesity) and suboptimal medication adherence further elevate the risk, while good dietary and sleep habits provide a small mitigating effect. Thus a risk score of 82 out of 100 reflects a substantial likelihood of disease progression and the need for intensified monitoring and therapeutic interventions.",82.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The provided individual has several factors that increase their risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered for this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor, as hypertension is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **High Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Elevated creatinine (3.5996509468794025 mg/dL) and BUN (38.21014773737798 mg/dL) levels indicate impaired kidney function, suggesting existing kidney damage or disease.
3. **Low GFR**: A GFR of 33.54079211139371 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range, indicating reduced kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.446266214674358 g/day) with an elevated ACR (202.51022243120673 mg/g) is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the current blood pressure is within a relatively normal range (114/70 mmHg), the use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests a history of hypertension management, which is a risk factor for CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption (18.5760803999558 units/week) are harmful to kidney health.
7. **High Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 195.02571513986635 mg/dL indicates poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for developing kidney disease, especially in the context of a family history of hypertension.
8. **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score, suggests significant kidney dysfunction affecting daily life.

However, factors somewhat mitigating this risk include good diet quality, high physical activity levels, and the absence of a family history of kidney disease or diabetes. Despite these, the cumulative effect of the risk factors outweighs the protective factors, leading to a high risk score for CKD.",87,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 92/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to the following key factors:
- **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 3.5996509468794025 mg/dL and a GFR of 33.54079211139371 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function.
- **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of 4.446266214674358 g/day of protein in urine and an ACR of 202.51022243120673 mg/g suggest significant kidney damage.
- **Family History of Hypertension**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease or diabetes, the presence of hypertension in the family could contribute to CKD risk, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
- **Current Hypertension Management**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for managing hypertension and slowing CKD progression, but the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (114/70 mmHg) are within a relatively controlled range, which may reflect effective management.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is high (9.265789171431258/10), other lifestyle factors such as smoking, high alcohol consumption (18.5760803999558 units/week), and a high BMI (32.45681483826366) contribute to the increased risk.
- **Laboratory Values and Medications**: Elevated fasting glucose (195.02571513986635 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.6992937622445465%), although not indicative of diabetes, suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can impact kidney health. The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even if minimal, also needs careful management due to their potential effects on kidney function.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue (9.09970774029112/10), nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score (2.8280089355379845/100), are consistent with advanced CKD and its complications.
- **Health Behaviors**: Low frequency of medical checkups (0.0327151863715111/year) and poor medication adherence (0.2228361523591426/10) exacerbate the risk, as regular monitoring",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Existing Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient has a low Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 22.674 mL/min/1.73 m², which is significantly below the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function. The creatinine level is elevated at 3.462753 mg/dL, further supporting compromised kidney function.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.8796167872627991 g/day) and a high Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 161.22399956250655 mg/g suggest kidney damage.

3. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure is 153 mmHg, which is higher than the recommended levels, and can accelerate kidney damage.

4. **Family and Medical History**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient has a history of UTIs, which can be a risk factor for CKD.

5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient smokes and consumes alcohol, both of which can worsen kidney function. The diet quality is relatively low, and physical activity is minimal, which can contribute to overall poorer health and increased risk of CKD progression.

6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, despite their potential to affect kidney function, along with symptoms like edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, further indicate compromised kidney health and potential CKD progression.

7. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While within ranges, the patient's electrolyte balance and lipid profile (including high total cholesterol and triglycerides) suggest a need for management to reduce cardiovascular risk factors that can also impact kidney health.

Given these factors, the patient is at a high risk for chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially adjustments to medications to slow disease progression.",87,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 93/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several significant factors:

1. **Low GFR (22.674 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: A GFR level below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function. The given value is significantly lower, suggesting severe kidney impairment.
2. **High Creatinine Level (3.462753 mg/dL)**: Elevated serum creatinine levels are a marker of reduced kidney function, and the value provided is above the normal range, indicating substantial kidney dysfunction.
3. **Presence of Protein in Urine (1.8796167872627991 g/day) and High ACR (161.22399956250655 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a key indicator of kidney damage, and the presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine, along with an elevated Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR), further supports kidney damage.
4. **History of UTIs**: While not directly causing CKD, recurrent UTIs can exacerbate kidney damage over time, especially if they reach the kidneys (pyelonephritis).
5. **Hypertension (Systolic BP 153 mmHg)**: Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
6. **High Fasting Glucose (154.67659265665668 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.081946805512229%)**: Although not in the diabetic range, these values are at the higher end, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which can impact kidney health over time.

Despite the high socioeconomic status and access to healthcare that comes with it, the combination of kidney function indicators, hypertension, and other health issues (such as smoking and high alcohol consumption) significantly elevates the risk of CKD.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk.
2. **Clinical Parameters**:
   - Elevated creatinine levels (3.49653567579014 mg/dL) indicate reduced kidney function.
   - High BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) level (36.218156104830754 mg/dL) suggests impaired kidney function.
   - The GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) of 104.6831580636851 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range but on the higher side for someone with other risk factors.
   - Significant proteinuria (4.645765192801958 g/day) and a high ACR (Albumin to Creatinine Ratio) of 191.85776496538543 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage.
3. **Medications and Lifestyle**:
   - The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) can potentially affect kidney function.
   - A relatively low diet quality and moderate alcohol consumption may contribute to the risk.
4. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**:
   - The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and quality of life.

Despite some protective factors such as no smoking, good sleep quality, and relatively good health literacy, the combination of family history, clinical indicators of kidney dysfunction, and certain lifestyle factors contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of these factors are crucial to prevent progression of the disease.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

**Rationale**  
1. **Advanced age & male sex** – Both are strong independent predictors of CKD progression.  
2. **Hypertension** – Systolic BP of 145 mmHg exceeds optimal targets and is a key driver of kidney damage.  
3. **Proteinuria** – 4.65 g/day and an ACR of ~192 mg/g are markedly high, indicating glomerular injury.  
4. **Elevated serum creatinine** (3.5 mg/dL) signals significant reduction in filtration capacity, even though GFR is reported >100 mL/min (likely a calculation artifact).

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data given, including medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of family kidney disease significantly increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 3.49653567579014 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as normal levels typically range from 0.5 to 1.2 mg/dL for adult males, though this can vary by laboratory.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The high level of protein in urine (4.645765192801958 g/day) is a marker of kidney damage, indicating that the kidneys are not functioning properly to filter waste and excess fluids.
4. **High Blood Pressure**: Although not drastically high, the systolic blood pressure of 145 mmHg is above the ideal range (< 120 mmHg), which can accelerate kidney damage over time.
5. **Use of Diuretics and NSAIDs**: The use of these medications, especially NSAIDs (4.0032362284462595 times/week), can potentially harm kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use.
6. **Presence of Symptoms**: Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of underlying kidney issues, though they are non-specific and can be attributed to various conditions.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate the risk include:
- **Good Sleep Quality**: High sleep quality can have protective effects on overall health, including kidney health.
- **High Health Literacy**: Good understanding of health information can lead to better health behaviors and management of conditions.
- **Regular Medical Checkups**: Frequent medical checkups can lead to early detection and management of potential kidney issues.

Overall, while there are several risk factors for CKD present, it's crucial to manage blood pressure, monitor kidney function regularly, and adhere to prescribed medications to slow the progression of kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical indicators, and health behaviors. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk score:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease is a significant risk factor for CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 145 mmHg is elevated and contributes to the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 3.49653567579014 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function.
4. **High Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 4.645765192801958 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Elevated ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 191.85776496538543 mg/g further indicates kidney damage.
6. **Medications and Substances**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can affect kidney function, though the impact varies depending on dosage and frequency.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the BMI is within a relatively healthy range, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels may not be optimally supportive of kidney health.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps may reflect underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and quality of life.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **No Previous AKI or UTIs**: The absence of previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs) reduces the risk.
- **Good Sleep Quality and Diet Quality**: These lifestyle factors can help in managing and slowing the progression of CKD.
- **Regular Medical Checkups and Good Health Literacy**: These behaviors indicate proactive management of health, potentially reducing the risk of CKD progression.

The provided information indicates a significant risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key factors contributing to this risk include:

1. **Family History**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, other factors are strongly indicative of risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic (141 mmHg) and diastolic (98 mmHg) blood pressure readings are a significant risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated levels (110.37 mg/dL and 6.36%, respectively) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing diabetes, a major cause of CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: A GFR of 59.32 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (4.27 g/day) and an elevated ACR (67.86 mg/g) further support kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and a high BMI (33.70) are risk factors for CKD. Although physical activity is relatively high (7.21 hours/week), the overall lifestyle factors contribute to the risk.
6. **Medications and Conditions**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, suggests the presence of conditions that can impact kidney health. The use of statins and antidiabetic medications also indicates management of conditions that are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting overall health and quality of life.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 reflects a significant concern for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease.

Rationale – main points
Category
Key finding
Impact on CKD risk
Baseline kidney function
eGFR ≈ 59 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD stage 3a)
Immediate indicator of established chronic kidney disease; drives overall risk upward.
Proteinuria
4.27 g/day; ACR ≈ 68 mg/g
Macro‑proteinuria is a strong predictor of rapid progression and mortality.
Blood pressure
141/98 mmHg
Hypertension (especially systolic >140 mmHg) accelerates kidney damage; ACE‑inhibitor use is good but BP remains uncontrolled.
Metabolic status
Fasting glucose ≈ 110 mg/dL; HbA1c ≈ 6.4 %
Prediabetic/diabetic range increases microvascular damage; antidiabetic meds needed but control is borderline.
Obesity
BMI ≈ 33.7
Adiposity contributes to hypertension, insulin resistance, and inflammatory milieu.
Lifestyle factors
Smoking (yes), moderate alcohol, 7 h/week activity, diet ≈ 7/10
Smoking and alcohol raise renal risk; diet quality is moderate, sleep quality lower than ideal.
Demographic & socio‑economic
Black, low socioeconomic status, 25 yrs
Black individuals have a higher baseline risk for CKD progression; lower SES can limit access to optimal care.
Lipid profile
Total ≈ 270 mg/dL, LDL ≈ 58 mg/dL, HDL ≈ 82 mg/dL, TG ≈ 294 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia further injures vasculature; statin therapy helps but lipid excess remains.
Medication adherence
8.7/10
Good adherence mitigates some risk but other factors still dominate.

The risk score is based on the provided factors and medical history. The main points contributing to this score are:

* **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg is higher than the normal range, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
* **Protein in urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.247755919957329 g/day of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage.
* **Family history and other medical conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the previous AKI and current hypertension are significant risk factors.
* **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and a less-than-ideal diet quality may also contribute to the risk.
* **Laboratory values**: Elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with a relatively low GFR, indicate impaired kidney function.
* **Electrolyte and lipid profiles**: While mostly within normal ranges, the overall metabolic and cardiovascular health, including high triglycerides, can impact kidney health.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 reflects a significant risk of developing or progressing chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage risk factors and slow disease progression.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

**Rationale**

1. **Age & Gender** – 65‑year‑old male, a known high‑risk demographic for CKD progression.  
2. **Blood pressure** – Systolic 160 mmHg (elevated) with a wide pulse pressure (160/60). Hypertension is a major CKD driver.  
3. **Proteinuria & ACR** – 3.25 g/day protein and 288 mg/g ACR approach the severe albuminuria threshold (>300 mg/g is stage 3; >200 mg/g is high risk).  
4. **eGFR & Creatinine** – eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m² is still normal, but the combination of albuminuria and prior AKI suggests early kidney injury.  
5. **NSAID use** – 8‑plus doses per week can precipitate or worsen renal impairment, especially in the presence of proteinuria.  
6. **Lifestyle & Comorbidities** – Smoking, moderate alcohol use, BMI ~27, and a history of acute kidney injury all elevate risk.  
7. **Metabolic profile** – Mildly elevated fasting glucose (107 mg/dL) and borderline triglycerides (391 mg/dL) indicate early metabolic disturbance that can affect renal health.  
8. **Symptom burden** – High fatigue and itching scores point to uremic manifestations, often seen in CKD.

The risk score is based on the analysis of the provided data, considering multiple factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) development and progression. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD. This event can lead to permanent kidney damage and increase the risk of future kidney problems.

2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg is higher than the recommended levels, which can damage kidney vessels and increase the risk of CKD.

3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.247755919957329 g/day of protein in the urine is indicative of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.

4. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI and current hypertension play more critical roles in determining the risk score.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: High BMI (26.987980927783845) and smoking can contribute to the risk of developing CKD. While alcohol consumption and physical activity levels are within relatively safe ranges, they could still impact overall health and potentially kidney function if not managed properly.

6. **Biochemical Markers**: The fasting glucose level is slightly elevated, which, although not diagnostic of diabetes, indicates impaired glucose regulation and can contribute to CKD risk. The HbA1c level is within a relatively normal range but on the higher end, suggesting good but not optimal glucose control.

7. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, despite being within a relatively controlled range, can pose a risk to kidney function, especially with long-term use. The absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors, which are often used to manage conditions that affect kidney health, might also contribute to a higher risk.

8. **Quality of Life and Health Behaviors**: While the quality of life score and health behaviors like adherence to medication and health literacy are relatively good, the presence of symptoms such as fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps, along with poor water quality, could indicate or contribute to kidney stress.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous AKI is a significant risk factor.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (160 mmHg) is a risk factor for CKD, despite the diastolic being within a relatively normal range.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is slightly elevated (84 mg/dL), and the HbA1c is near the upper limit of normal (5.45506%), indicating potential pre-diabetic conditions which can contribute to CKD risk.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated (8586 mg/dL), and the GFR, although within the normal range (18 mL/min/1.73 m²), combined with the presence of protein in the urine (329 g/day) and a high ACR (287.989744 mg/g), suggests some degree of kidney impairment.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, high alcohol consumption (75 units/week), and relatively low physical activity (3.229532 hours/week) are all risk factors for CKD.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (8.725109 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and while statin use is beneficial for cardiovascular health, the overall medication adherence and health literacy are important for managing CKD risk factors.

These factors collectively contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to medical recommendations are crucial to mitigate this risk.",100,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Age & Sex – At 65 years and male, baseline CKD risk is higher compared with younger or female peers.
Proteinuria & ACR – 3.25 g/day proteinuria and ACR 288 mg/g are both well above normal thresholds, indicating significant glomerular damage.
Prior AKI – History of acute kidney injury is a strong predictor of future CKD progression.
Hypertension – Systolic BP 160 mmHg is markedly elevated; diastolic is low but the high systolic pressure itself drives kidney damage.
NSAID Use – 8.3 doses/week can precipitate or worsen renal perfusion deficits, especially with existing proteinuria.
Lifestyle Factors – Smoking, moderate alcohol use, and a BMI ≈27 contribute to vascular and metabolic stress on the kidneys.
Lipid Profile – High triglycerides (391 mg/dL) and low HDL (28 mg/dL) reflect a pro‑atherogenic state that can impair renal microvasculature.
Other Labs – Creatinine 1.17 mg/dL and GFR ~90 mL/min/1.73 m² are at the upper normal range but, combined with proteinuria, signal early CKD.
Symptom Burden – Fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, and itching suggest ongoing uremic toxicity.
QoL – A score of 27.6/100 indicates substantial disease impact, reinforcing the clinical significance of the renal findings.
Taken together, these factors place the individual at a moderate‑to‑high risk of CKD progression, warranting close monitoring and possible early interventions.",78.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data given, including demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History and Medical Background**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) is a notable risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

2. **Clinical Measurements**:
   - Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (161/97 mmHg) increases the risk of CKD.
   - The fasting glucose level (106.495 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.969%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - The creatinine level (0.796982 mg/dL) and BUN (13.895304 mg/dL) are within ranges that might not immediately indicate severe kidney impairment but, when considered with other factors, contribute to the overall risk.
   - The GFR (78.053 mL/min/1.73 m²) is slightly below the normal range, suggesting some degree of kidney function impairment.
   - Significant proteinuria (4.572872 g/day) and an elevated ACR (234.348 mg/g) are strong indicators of kidney damage.

3. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**:
   - A BMI of 25.501807381304108 indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - Moderate alcohol consumption (3.671 units/week) and physical activity (6.717 hours/week) have mixed effects on health but are not strongly indicative of increased CKD risk in this context.
   - Good diet quality (7.516/10) and poor sleep quality (5.839/10) have opposing effects on health, with better diet quality potentially mitigating some risks.

4. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (9.435 times/week) can impact kidney function and increase the risk of CKD, especially with frequent NSAID use.
   - There's no reported exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, which reduces the risk from these factors.

The calculated risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History and Previous Conditions**: The absence of family kidney disease and hypertension history is positive, but the presence of previous UTIs is a risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (161/97 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for kidney disease, as high blood pressure can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (106.495 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.969%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The calculated GFR (78.053 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within a relatively normal range but on the lower end, and the presence of protein in urine (4.572 g/day) with an elevated ACR (234.348 mg/g) suggests kidney damage or disease.
5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: A relatively low level of physical activity (6.717 hours/week), moderate alcohol consumption (3.671 units/week), and less-than-ideal diet quality (7.516/10) contribute to the risk. The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (9.435 times/week) can also affect kidney function.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, high levels of fatigue (9.002/10), frequent nausea/vomiting (6.449 times/week), and muscle cramps (6.757 times/week) suggest significant kidney-related symptoms affecting quality of life.

These factors together indicate a significant risk of chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments (including diet, exercise, and possibly reducing NSAID use), and adherence to prescribed medications are crucial to manage and potentially mitigate this risk.",74,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

* Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (161/97 mmHg) increases the risk of CKD.
* Presence of protein in urine (4.572872681631024 g/day) and high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (234.3481421174203 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
* History of UTIs and use of diuretics may also contribute to the increased risk.
* Elevated fasting glucose (106.49502182726924 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.969379990443224%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* Low medication adherence (3.33858313491348/10) and infrequent medical checkups (0.1561615074575466/year) may hinder proper management of underlying conditions, further increasing the risk.

However, some factors, such as the absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and relatively preserved kidney function (GFR: 78.05328335498885 mL/min/1.73 m²), partially mitigate the risk. Nevertheless, the overall risk score remains high, indicating a need for close monitoring and management of underlying conditions to prevent CKD progression.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

* **Family history of kidney disease**: The presence of family kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **High blood pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 149 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 93 mmHg are above the normal range, which can damage kidneys over time.
* **Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c**: A fasting glucose of 199 mg/dL and HbA1c of 6.43% indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* **Protein in urine**: The presence of 4.4 g/day of protein in urine is a sign of kidney damage.
* **Elevated creatinine and BUN**: Although the GFR is within the normal range, the elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest some degree of kidney impairment.
* **Lifestyle factors**: A high BMI, low diet quality, and low physical activity level may contribute to the development of CKD.
* **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs and presence of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, and itching may also be related to kidney dysfunction.

However, the relatively preserved GFR and good water quality are factors that slightly reduce the risk score. Overall, the combination of these factors results in a high risk score for CKD.",74,Asian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score:** 78/100

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 159 mmHg is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: With a fasting glucose of 118.95 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.88%, there is an indication of impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease, even though there's no reported family history of diabetes.
4. **Low GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 33.20 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 4.18 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The levels of certain electrolytes, such as potassium (3.86 mEq/L), although within the normal range, in the context of other abnormalities, can indicate kidney dysfunction.
7. **Symptoms**: Edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low quality of life score (39.68/100), are consistent with advanced kidney disease.
8. **Medications**: The use of diuretics, NSAIDs, statins, and antidiabetic medications suggests management of conditions that are risk factors for CKD or complications of CKD itself.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, indicating a need for close monitoring and potentially aggressive management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and other contributing factors to slow the progression of kidney disease.",87,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 84/100

The calculated risk score indicates a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The rationale for this score is based on the following key factors:

* **Family history of hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **High blood pressure**: The systolic BP of 159 mmHg and diastolic BP of 79 mmHg are both higher than the recommended levels, putting additional strain on the kidneys.
* **Elevated creatinine and decreased GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.276519298215982 mg/dL and a GFR of 33.19571107824699 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function.
* **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.179211825757712 g/day) and an elevated ACR (229.6898444697347 mg/g) are both indicators of kidney damage.
* **Diabetes indicators**: The HbA1c level of 8.883420833634961% and fasting glucose of 118.9528431031143 mg/dL suggest poor blood sugar control, which can contribute to CKD.
* **Medications and lifestyle**: The use of diuretics, NSAIDs, and antidiabetic medications, along with a relatively low physical activity level and poor diet quality, may also contribute to the increased risk.
* **Symptoms**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score, are all consistent with CKD.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP (136 mmHg) and Diastolic BP (93 mmHg) are slightly elevated, which can increase the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Blood Test Results**: The fasting glucose level (77.55 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.19%) are within normal limits, suggesting good glucose control. However, the creatinine level (2.52 mg/dL) is elevated, indicating reduced kidney function. The estimated GFR (101.69 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range but at the higher end, which might not accurately reflect kidney function given the elevated creatinine level.
4. **Electrolytes and Proteins**: The presence of protein in urine (0.92 g/day) and an elevated ACR (100.59 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle and Medications**: The high BMI (30.49), moderate alcohol consumption (8.45 units/week), and use of NSAIDs (9.22 times/week) may contribute to increased risk. The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the presence of edema and relatively low medication adherence (2.44/10) and health literacy (2.25/10) are concerns.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue (7.37/10), nausea/vomiting (4.78 times/week), muscle cramps (2.35 times/week), and itching (4.82/10) suggest significant symptoms that may be related to kidney function or overall health.

Given these factors, the calculated risk score indicates a moderate to high risk for CKD. It is essential to monitor kidney function closely, adjust medications as necessary, improve lifestyle factors (such as weight management, reducing NSAID use, and increasing physical activity), and enhance health literacy and medication adherence to mitigate this risk. Regular medical checkups (currently 0.76 times/year) should be increased to ensure early detection and management of any worsening",74,Asian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 55/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors compensates for this.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure (136 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (93 mmHg) are both higher than ideal, which can increase the risk of CKD.
3. **Kidney Function**: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 101.69 mL/min/1.73 m², which falls within the normal range but on the higher end, and the creatinine level is 2.52 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated, indicating potential kidney strain.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.92 g/day) with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 100.59 mg/g suggests kidney damage.
5. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the high frequency of NSAID use (9.22 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function. The lifestyle factors such as a high BMI (30.49), moderate alcohol consumption (8.45 units/week), and less than ideal diet quality (8.37/10) and physical activity (6.41 hours/week) also contribute to the risk.
6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, moderate fatigue (7.37/10), occasional nausea/vomiting (4.78 times/week), muscle cramps (2.35 times/week), and itching (4.82/10) can be indicative of CKD progression and its impact on quality of life.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups (0.76/year), low medication adherence (2.44/10), and limited health literacy (2.25/10) can hinder the management and progression of CKD.

These factors collectively elevate the risk score, indicating a need for closer monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and adherence to medical advice to manage and potentially slow the progression of CKD.",74,Asian,Black,"Risk Score: 68/100

The risk score is based on various factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key points contributing to this score include:

- **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk.
- **Lifestyle**: BMI is in the obese range, which increases the risk of CKD. However, diet quality and sleep quality are relatively good, which are positive factors.
- **Medical History and Current Health**: The absence of previous AKI and UTIs is positive, but the presence of edema and use of ACE inhibitors (which can be indicative of hypertension or heart failure) are risk factors.
- **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: Systolic BP is slightly elevated, and while fasting glucose and HbA1c are within normal limits, the use of antidiabetic medications suggests a risk or presence of diabetes, a major CKD risk factor.
- **Kidney Function Tests**: Elevated creatinine and protein in urine (as indicated by ACR) are significant risk factors for CKD. The GFR, although within a relatively normal range, combined with other renal markers, indicates some level of kidney stress.
- **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: Generally within normal ranges but with borderline values that could indicate metabolic syndrome or other renal stressors.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of CKD progression or other serious health issues.
- **Medications and Exposures**: Use of NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, and the presence of antidiabetic medications are considered.

Given these factors, while there are some protective elements (good diet quality, no family history of CKD, etc.), the overall profile suggests a significant risk of CKD due to obesity, potential hypertensive and diabetic conditions, renal function indicators, and lifestyle factors. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, glucose levels, and renal function, along with lifestyle modifications (weight loss, increased physical activity, and potentially reducing NSAIDs use), are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,Asian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 65/100
Brief Rationale
Factor
Contribution to CKD risk
Age (73 y)
Advanced age is a strong independent risk factor for CKD progression.
BMI (30.5)
Obesity is linked to glomerular hyperfiltration and later decline in kidney function.
Blood pressure (136/93 mmHg)
Elevated diastolic pressure and borderline systolic hypertension increase glomerular damage.
HbA1c (6.2 %)
Mild hyperglycaemia (pre‑diabetes) adds metabolic stress on the kidneys.
Serum creatinine (2.52 mg/dL)
Although GFR is > 90 mL/min/1.73 m², the creatinine level is on the upper end for a 73‑year‑old, indicating early tubular dysfunction.
Proteinuria (0.92 g/day)
> 0.5 g/day is a marker of significant glomerular leak.
Albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio (100 mg/g)
Falls in the microalbuminuria range, a known predictor of progression.
Medication use
ACE inhibitor therapy is protective, but frequent NSAID use (~9 ×/week) can counteract this benefit.
Edema & fatigue
Clinical symptoms suggest possible volume overload and declining renal reserve.
Lifestyle factors
Moderate alcohol, reasonable sleep, and physical activity slightly mitigate risk but BMI and NSAID exposure offset benefits.
Overall assessment:The combination of older age, obesity, hypertension, mild hyperglycaemia, proteinuria, and frequent NSAID use places the patient in a moderate‑to‑high risk category for CKD progression. A score of 65/100 reflects the presence of several key risk drivers while acknowledging protective factors such as ACE‑inhibitor therapy.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 158 mmHg and diastolic BP of 116 mmHg are significantly higher than the recommended levels, indicating hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Fasting glucose of 173.29 mg/dL and HbA1c of 8.52% suggest poorly controlled diabetes, another primary risk factor for CKD.
3. **Reduced Kidney Function**: A GFR of 26.08 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: The presence of 0.97 g/day of protein in urine and an ACR of 233.23 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage, as they signify the kidneys are not filtering waste properly and are allowing proteins to leak into the urine.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: Although within the ranges provided, the levels of certain electrolytes like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, along with the elevated BUN level, suggest that the kidneys are struggling to maintain electrolyte balance, further indicating CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A BMI of 30.09 suggests obesity, which is a risk factor for developing CKD. The history of smoking and moderate to high alcohol consumption also contribute to the increased risk.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, especially at a frequency of 8.38 times/week, can be harmful to kidney function over time, especially in the context of existing kidney issues.
8. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, are consistent with symptoms associated with CKD and indicate a significant impact on the quality of life.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors:

1. **Impaired Kidney Function**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 26.08388623443144 mL/min/1.73 m², which is significantly lower than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.9689708316946744 g/day) and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 233.22996377552604 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
3. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressures are elevated (158/116 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Diabetes**: Although there is no family history of diabetes, the patient's fasting glucose level is high (173.2894463335962 mg/dL), and the HbA1c level is 8.52282917236132%, indicating poor glucose control.
5. **Other Risk Factors**: The patient's lifestyle, including smoking, high BMI (30.09360721408141), and relatively low physical activity (8.284997121442693 hours/week), also contribute to the increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, although not excessive, may further stress the kidneys, but there is no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, which could have increased the risk.

Considering these factors, the patient is at a high risk for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly adjustments to the current medication regimen.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 85/100
Rationale (main points)
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
eGFR
26 mL/min/1.73 m²
Stage 4 CKD → very high progression risk.
Albumin‑to‑Creatinine Ratio (ACR)
233 mg/g
> 300 mg/g is high, but 233 mg/g still indicates significant nephropathy and accelerates decline.
Blood pressure
158/116 mmHg
Severe uncontrolled hypertension strongly promotes CKD progression.
Diabetes control
HbA1c 8.5 % and fasting glucose 173 mg/dL
Poor glycemic control contributes to diabetic nephropathy and adds to overall risk.
Age
88 years
Advanced age itself is a risk factor for faster decline and complications.
Lifestyle
Smoking, BMI ≈ 30, moderate alcohol use
These increase cardiovascular and renal stress.
Medications
Frequent NSAID use (8×/week) + diuretics
NSAIDs can acutely worsen GFR; diuretics may mask edema and alter volume status.
Other labs
Mildly elevated BUN, normal electrolytes
Support existing renal impairment but no acute crisis.
Symptoms/QoL
Moderate fatigue, itching, frequent cramps
Reflect uremic sequelae, hinting at more advanced disease.
Socio‑economic & education
High SES & good health literacy
May improve compliance but does not offset the physiological risk.
Combining these elements—low eGFR, high albuminuria, uncontrolled hypertension & diabetes, old age, and adverse habits—the overall likelihood of CKD progression or cardiovascular complications is very high. Thus a risk score of 85 out of 100 reflects a high‑to‑very‑high risk category that warrants aggressive monitoring, blood‑pressure control, diabetes management, and nephrology referral.",85.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health status. The main points contributing to this score are:

* **Family history of kidney disease**: Having a family history of kidney disease increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (179 mmHg) is above the normal range, which can damage kidneys and increase the risk of CKD.
* **Impaired kidney function**: The patient's GFR (25.28 mL/min/1.73 m²) and creatinine level (1.01 mg/dL) indicate impaired kidney function, which is a key indicator of CKD.
* **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.07 g/day) and a high ACR (122.59 mg/g) are signs of kidney damage and increase the risk of CKD progression.
* **Lifestyle factors**: The patient's smoking habit, low physical activity (8.37 hours/week), and poor diet quality (4.92/10) may also contribute to the risk of CKD.
* **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may be beneficial in managing CKD, but the frequent use of NSAIDs (6.05 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 74 out of 100. This relatively high score is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease significantly increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 179 mmHg is significantly above the normal range, contributing to the risk of kidney damage and CKD progression.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 25.28 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.069 g/day of protein in the urine suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances and Elevated Creatinine**: The levels of potassium (5.499 mEq/L) and creatinine (1.011 mg/dL) are near or slightly above the upper limits of the normal range, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the individual has a high level of physical activity (8.37 hours/week), the high BMI (35.15), smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption (5.03 units/week) also contribute to the overall risk profile.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension and fluid balance, which are relevant to CKD, but the frequency of NSAIDs use (6.05 times/week) could potentially exacerbate kidney issues due to their nephrotoxic effects.

Despite a relatively good quality of life score (96.58/100) and adherence to medication (3.5/10), the combination of genetic predisposition, existing kidney function impairment, and lifestyle factors substantially increases the risk of chronic kidney disease.

Renal function: eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 3b CKD) and significant proteinuria (1.07 g/day) and ACR 122 mg/g are strong indicators of ongoing kidney damage.
Blood pressure: Systolic 179 mmHg (with a normal diastolic) reflects uncontrolled hypertension, a major CKD risk factor.
Metabolic profile: Elevated BMI (35.1), smoking, and moderate alcohol use compound cardiovascular and renal risk.
Demographics & genetics: Being male, Black, and having a family history of kidney disease further increases susceptibility.
Medication burden: While ACEi/diuretics can protect kidneys, the concurrent NSAID use (≈6 ×/week) elevates nephrotoxicity risk.
Other labs: Slight hyperkalemia and mild anemia (Hb 12.2 g/dL) are typical sequelae of declining renal function.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease significantly increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: A systolic blood pressure of 179 mmHg indicates hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.069024294477109 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 122.58870411578496 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 25.279461921679022 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a key diagnostic criterion for CKD.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, low physical activity (8.37289859058485 hours/week), and a relatively low diet quality (4.924107867153719/10) can all contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Electrolytes**: The use of NSAIDs (6.052202523433196 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and electrolyte imbalances, such as elevated potassium levels (5.499781129262785 mEq/L), can be a consequence of kidney dysfunction.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, although not specific to CKD, can be associated with advanced kidney disease and contribute to a reduced quality of life.

However, factors that might mitigate the risk or indicate management of the condition include the use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which are common treatments for hypertension and CKD, and the absence of antidiabetic medications, suggesting that diabetes, another major risk factor for CKD, is not currently a concern. The relatively good health literacy and medication adherence also suggest proactive management of health conditions. Overall, the combination of genetic predisposition, current kidney function indicators, lifestyle factors, and the presence of symptoms related to kidney health contribute to the assigned risk score.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: **84/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

1. **Elevated blood pressure**: Systolic BP of 160 mmHg and diastolic BP of 113 mmHg are significantly higher than the ideal range, which puts a strain on the kidneys.
2. **High fasting glucose and HbA1c levels**: Indicative of poor glucose control, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated creatinine levels**: Suggests impaired kidney function, as creatinine is a waste product that the kidneys are supposed to filter out.
4. **Protein in urine and high ACR**: Proteinuria is a hallmark of kidney damage, and the high ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio) further supports this.
5. **Family history and lifestyle factors**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's lifestyle factors such as low physical activity, poor diet quality, and high BMI contribute to the increased risk.
6. **Medication use and adherence**: The use of ACE inhibitors and statins is beneficial, but the patient's medication adherence score is low, which may impact the effectiveness of these treatments.

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive analysis of the given data. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk.
2. **Medical History**: No previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) or UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) suggests a lower risk due to absence of these common kidney disease precursors.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic (160 mmHg) and diastolic (113 mmHg) blood pressure significantly increases the risk of kidney disease, as hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Blood Glucose**: High fasting glucose (167.895 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.903%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for kidney disease, especially diabetic nephropathy.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: Elevated creatinine (2.941 mg/dL) and high protein in urine (3.588 g/day) with an ACR of 124.471 mg/g suggest impaired kidney function and potential kidney damage, which are direct indicators of CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Low physical activity (2.728 hours/week), moderate alcohol consumption (6.004 units/week), and a diet quality score of 4.279 out of 10 may contribute to an increased risk of CKD due to their impact on blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and overall health.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the presence of symptoms like fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a relatively low QoL score (81.24), may indicate some level of kidney dysfunction.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Low frequency of medical checkups (0.744 times/year), moderate medication adherence (2.538/10), and limited health literacy (1.785/10) can negatively affect disease management and prevention.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (160/113 mmHg) is significantly higher than the recommended levels, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The patient's fasting glucose (167.89532952107183 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.903715826413176%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.5886586064243304 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (124.47152126000954 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
4. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The patient is taking ACE inhibitors, which is appropriate for managing CKD, but also reports infrequent medical checkups (0.7448123821765216/year) and relatively low medication adherence (2.5382703308299783/10) and health literacy (1.7859670613541725/10), which may negatively impact disease management.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances and Other Factors**: Elevated potassium (5.044067735163981 mEq/L) and phosphorus (3.7879539420604784 mg/dL) levels, along with high total and LDL cholesterol, contribute to the overall risk profile.

However, the patient's good sleep quality, absence of smoking, and good water quality exposure are positive factors. The relatively high GFR (112.25390400571702 mL/min/1.73 m²) might seem protective, but in the context of other abnormalities, it does not significantly mitigate the overall risk. Considering these factors, the risk score for chronic kidney disease is 74 out of 100.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100

Hypertension and diabetes are the most potent drivers of CKD; both are uncontrolled here.
Proteinuria at 3.5 g/day is a clear marker of glomerular injury and strongly predicts progression.
The discrepancy between a high creatinine and a normal GFR suggests a potential calculation error or rapid loss of renal reserve not yet reflected in the GFR.
Medication adherence and health literacy are low, further elevating risk by limiting effective blood‑pressure and glucose control.
Given the clustering of these high‑risk features, a score of 78/100 reflects substantial risk for ongoing CKD progression and emphasizes the need for aggressive management of blood pressure, glucose, and proteinuria, along with improved medication adherence.",78.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated, indicating potential hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated, suggesting some level of kidney impairment. However, the GFR is within the normal range, which might indicate early stages of kidney dysfunction or variability in measurement.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests that there is ongoing management of conditions like hypertension and possibly early signs of CKD, which can affect kidney function.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, and a relatively low level of physical activity are all risk factors for CKD.
7. **Diet Quality and BMI**: A high BMI and moderate diet quality may contribute to the risk, as obesity and poor diet are risk factors for developing conditions that lead to CKD, such as diabetes and hypertension.

However, the relatively good sleep quality, absence of family kidney disease history, and good water quality exposure are positive factors. Overall, the combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and current health indicators places the individual at a heightened risk for chronic kidney disease.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale (key points)
Renal function markers:
Creatinine 2.21 mg/dL (elevated) and proteinuria 4 g/day with an ACR of 189 mg/g strongly indicate active kidney damage.
GFR remains 99 mL/min/1.73 m², but the presence of albuminuria and high creatinine suggests early functional decline.
Metabolic and cardiovascular risk:
HbA1c 8.93 % indicates uncontrolled diabetes, a major CKD driver.
Diastolic BP 116 mmHg is near the upper limit of normal, and chronic hypertension is a well‑known CKD accelerant.
BMI 36 and a sedentary lifestyle (≈2 h wk⁻¹) increase glomerular hyperfiltration risk.
Medication & exposure profile:
ACE inhibitor therapy is protective, yet frequent NSAID use (~8 × wk) can worsen renal perfusion.
No statins, but lipid profile is within normal ranges.
Symptom burden & quality of life:
High fatigue, nausea, and itching reflect possible uremic toxin accumulation.
Low health literacy (2.4/10) may impair self‑management and adherence despite a moderate medication adherence score (5.8/10).
Combining these clinical indicators, the overall risk of progressing to moderate–severe CKD is substantial—hence a score of 78/100.",78.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

* High BMI (36.084333016875135) indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* Family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
* Elevated HbA1c (8.933655349140594%) and fasting glucose (93.478325816418 mg/dL) levels, suggesting impaired glucose regulation.
* High protein in urine (4.04590353350692 g/day) and ACR (189.15721298358952 mg/g) levels, indicating kidney damage.
* Elevated creatinine (2.2097096404993604 mg/dL) and low hemoglobin (10.669657453450911 g/dL) levels, which may indicate impaired kidney function.
* Presence of fatigue (9.907860371289104/10), nausea/vomiting (6.3756032617384 times/week), muscle cramps (1.3940745507770955 times/week), and itching (9.625795817735428/10), which are common symptoms of CKD.
* Low health literacy (2.4218768572208305/10) and moderate medication adherence (5.82449177306856/10), which may impact disease management and progression.

However, some factors reduce the risk score, such as:
* High socioeconomic status and education level, which may facilitate access to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices.
* Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, which reduces the risk of environmental toxins contributing to CKD.
* Regular medical checkups (1.2675422115135424 times/year), which allows for monitoring and management of CKD risk factors.

Rationale (key points)
Hypertension – Systolic/diastolic BP of 172/118 mmHg is markedly above the 140/90 threshold, a strong driver of CKD progression.
Diabetes – Fasting glucose 142 mg/dL and HbA1c 9.99 % indicate poorly controlled diabetes, a top CKD risk factor.
Proteinuria & ACR – Urine protein 1.10 g/day and ACR 276 mg/g are at the high end of normal, reflecting significant glomerular damage.
eGFR – Although still ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m², the value 82.8 mL/min is a modest decline and may accelerate if risk factors persist.
NSAID use – Taking NSAIDs 4–5 times per week can exacerbate renal injury, especially with existing hypertension/diabetes.
Lipid profile – Elevated LDL (196 mg/dL) and triglycerides (224 mg/dL) increase atherosclerotic risk, compounding vascular contributions to CKD.
Other factors – Good diet and sleep quality, but low medication adherence score (~7/10) and lack of antidiabetic therapy suggest suboptimal disease control.

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive health and medical information given. The main points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as these conditions are significant risk factors for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (172/118 mmHg) is a major risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney vessels and reduce their ability to function properly.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated fasting glucose (142.46351549409633 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.99268243449234%) levels indicate poor blood sugar control, which is a significant risk factor for developing CKD.
4. **Kidney Function**: Although the GFR (82.80083253803716 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (1.0984072528656774 g/day) and an elevated ACR (276.29174076334573 mg/g) suggests kidney damage or disease.
5. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for blood pressure control and kidney protection, but the presence of symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a moderate quality of life score, may indicate underlying kidney issues or the side effects of medications.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality and physical activity levels are good, the moderate alcohol consumption and higher than ideal BMI could contribute to health risks, including CKD.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 indicates a significant risk of chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring, management of blood pressure and diabetes, and possibly adjustments in lifestyle and medication to mitigate this risk.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Risk factor
Indicator
Impact on CKD risk
Hypertension
172/118 mmHg
Severely elevated systolic‑diastolic pressure strongly accelerates glomerular damage.
Diabetes control
Fasting glucose 142 mg/dL, HbA1c 9.99%
Poor glycaemic control drives progressive nephropathy.
Proteinuria & ACR
1.10 g/day, ACR 276 mg/g
High albumin excretion (A3 range) is a key marker of early CKD and predicts faster decline.
GFR
82.8 mL/min/1.73 m²
Mildly reduced (stage 2) but combined with albuminuria pushes risk higher.
NSAID use
4.3 times/week
Chronic NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion and precipitate acute or chronic injury.
Family history
Hypertension & diabetes
Genetic predisposition amplifies susceptibility.
Lifestyle
BMI ~19 (lean), active, good diet/sleep
These factors mitigate risk but do not offset the strong clinical indicators above.
Overall, the combination of uncontrolled hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes, significant albuminuria, and frequent NSAID use places this patient at moderate‑to‑high risk for CKD progression, warranting aggressive blood‑pressure and glucose management, NSAID avoidance, and close monitoring of renal function.",78.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

*   **Established Kidney Damage**: The patient has a history of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which increases the risk of developing CKD. Additionally, the patient's current kidney function, as indicated by a GFR of 17.85688030001115 mL/min/1.73 m², is severely impaired, consistent with stage 5 CKD.
*   **Proteinuria**: The presence of significant protein in the urine (4.888961579749479 g/day) and an elevated Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 72.96152831208381 mg/g, suggesting kidney damage and increasing the risk of CKD progression.
*   **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure (149/112 mmHg) is elevated, which can both cause and be a consequence of CKD. Uncontrolled hypertension can accelerate kidney damage.
*   **Family History**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's personal medical history and current health status are significant risk factors for CKD.
*   **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient's diet quality (0.7439568576418487/10), while not severely poor, could be improved. Regular physical activity (6.50307157307256 hours/week) and good sleep quality (6.684210867951233/10) are positives, but the low BMI (17.642515096982518) and moderate alcohol consumption (4.521983872533843 units/week) could also impact overall health and CKD risk.
*   **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for managing CKD, especially in the context of proteinuria. However, the frequent use of NSAIDs (6.745385800503287 times/week) could potentially worsen kidney function.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

* **Previously experienced Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI significantly increases the risk of developing CKD, as it can cause permanent damage to kidney tissues.
* **Impaired kidney function indicators**: The patient has a low Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 17.85688030001115 mL/min/1.73 m², which is indicative of severe kidney impairment. Additionally, the elevated serum creatinine level (4.682497953831096 mg/dL) and high Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level (31.930211465598013 mg/dL) further support this.
* **Proteinuria**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.888961579749479 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 72.96152831208381 mg/g are markers of kidney damage.
* **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure is elevated (149/112 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD progression, as it can further damage kidney tissues.
* **Family history and other health factors**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's age (90 years), low BMI (17.642515096982518), and certain lifestyle factors, such as low diet quality (0.7439568576418487/10) and the presence of symptoms like edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, contribute to the overall risk assessment.

Despite some protective factors, such as the absence of smoking, moderate physical activity, and good sleep quality, the cumulative effect of the mentioned risk factors results in a high risk score for CKD. The patient's current medications, including ACE inhibitors and statins, are appropriate for managing CKD risk factors but do not negate the need for careful monitoring and management of the condition.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 88/100**  

**Rationale (Key points)**  
1. **Renal Function** – eGFR ≈ 18 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD stage 4) and creatinine 4.68 mg/dL strongly indicate advanced disease.  
2. **Proteinuria & ACR** – 4.9 g/day and 73 mg/g reflect heavy albuminuria, a powerful predictor of progression and mortality.  
3. **Hypertension** – Systolic/diastolic 149/112 mmHg with no diuretic therapy; uncontrolled BP accelerates CKD decline.  
4. **Prior AKI** – History of acute kidney injury adds to cumulative kidney injury and increases risk of irreversible loss.  
5. **Lifestyle/Medications** – High NSAID use (≈ 7 times/week) further insults the kidneys; although an ACE‑inhibitor is prescribed, lack of diuretic may limit BP control.  
6. **Metabolic Factors** – Mild hypertriglyceridemia, borderline glucose (HbA1c 6.2 %) and low BMI (under‑weight) contribute to overall frailty and cardiovascular risk, which are linked to",88.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

* Elevated creatinine levels (1.157 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (55.818 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
* High blood pressure (137/60 mmHg) and the use of ACE inhibitors suggest hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
* The presence of protein in the urine (1.467 g/day) and high ACR (187.188 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
* The patient's high BMI (33.72894557941329), smoking, and low diet quality (0.2584866384007345/10) are additional risk factors for CKD.
* The patient's HbA1c level (9.185417019587083%) is high, indicating poor glucose control, which can contribute to CKD progression.
* The patient's history of taking NSAIDs (6.32775914968739 times/week) can also increase the risk of CKD.

Brief Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD risk
Evidence in this profile
eGFR 55.8 mL/min/1.73 m²
Stage 3a CKD – baseline risk for progression
Moderate decline, but still above 45 mL/min threshold for severe disease
Proteinuria 1.47 g/day / ACR 187 mg/g
Strong predictor of progression
Both values exceed the normal range, indicating significant tubular/glomerular injury
Hypertension (137/60 mmHg)
Accelerates kidney damage
Systolic BP > 130 mmHg; diastolic is low but overall BP control is suboptimal
Hyperglycemia (HbA1c 9.2 %)
Major driver of renal decline
Even without formal diabetes diagnosis, high HbA1c points to poorly controlled glucose
Obesity (BMI ≈ 34)
Increases glomerular hyperfiltration and inflammation
BMI >30 is a known risk factor for CKD progression
Smoking & NSAID use
Exacerbate renal injury
Frequent NSAID use (≈6× / wk) and ongoing smoking add insult to the kidney
Medication profile
Partial mitigation
ACE‑I and statin therapy help, but absence of diuretics and strict BP control limits benefit
Lifestyle (low diet quality, moderate alcohol)
Contributes to metabolic stress
Poor diet and alcohol intake can worsen insulin resistance and hypertension

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. For this individual, the main points contributing to the risk score are:

1. **Age and Socioeconomic Status**: At 82 years old, age is a significant risk factor. High socioeconomic status may provide better access to healthcare, but it does not negate the risk associated with age.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**:
   - **BMI of 33.73** indicates obesity, a risk factor for CKD.
   - **Smoking** is a significant risk factor for CKD.
   - **Alcohol consumption** of 14.89 units/week is relatively high and can be harmful.
   - **Low Physical Activity** (5.38 hours/week) and **Poor Diet Quality** (2.58/10) contribute to the risk.
   - **Sleep Quality** is average (5.38/10), which may not significantly impact CKD risk directly but can influence overall health.

3. **Medical History and Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces genetic predisposition risks. No previous AKI or UTIs also lowers the risk.

4. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 137 mmHg is slightly elevated, which can contribute to CKD risk.

5. **Laboratory Results**:
   - **Fasting Glucose** is within normal limits, but **HbA1c** is elevated at 9.19%, indicating poor glucose control over time.
   - **Creatinine** is slightly elevated at 1.16 mg/dL, and **GFR** is 55.82 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating reduced kidney function.
   - **Protein in urine** (1.47 g/day) and **ACR** (187.19 mg/g) are elevated, indicating kidney damage.
   - Electrolytes and cholesterol levels are mostly within normal ranges but with slight deviations, particularly elevated triglycerides.

6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, and the use of statins helps with cholesterol management. Frequent NSAIDs use can be harmful to kidney function.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History of Diabetes:** Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels:** High levels of creatinine (2.7198619090384053 mg/dL) and BUN (17.945036519146115 mg/dL) are indicators of impaired kidney function.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria):** The presence of protein in the urine (0.99859758504392 g/day) is a significant risk factor for CKD, suggesting kidney damage.
4. **Hemoglobin Levels:** Low hemoglobin (10.825846524905742 g/dL) could indicate anemia, which is common in CKD patients due to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Elevated potassium (5.23853965773999 mEq/L) and altered calcium and phosphorus levels can be associated with CKD, reflecting disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism.
6. **Symptoms:** Presence of edema, significant fatigue (6.048741293313153/10), muscle cramps (3.3348990155667133 times/week), and itching (4.629931681908131/10) are indicative of CKD progression and its complications.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle:** The use of antidiabetic medications and NSAIDs (7.815667590268928 times/week) can impact kidney function, and the patient's lifestyle factors, including high BMI (36.873485140066784) and low physical activity (0.6710846152635164 hours/week), contribute to the overall risk.

1. **Albuminuria/Proteinuria** – ACR of **249 mg/g** (borderline high) and 1 g/day protein excretion places the patient in the *moderate‑to‑high* CKD risk category per KDIGO guidelines, even though the GFR is still within normal limits.

2. **GFR & Serum Creatinine** – While the estimated GFR is 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (Stage 1/2), a creatinine of 2.72 mg/dL is markedly elevated for a 66‑year‑old female, suggesting early functional loss that may decline over time.

2. **High Blood Pressure**: With a systolic blood pressure of 147 mmHg, you are at a higher risk since uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine of 2.7198619090384053 mg/dL and BUN of 17.945036519146115 mg/dL suggest impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine ( Proteinuria )**: The presence of 0.99859758504392 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it indicates kidney damage.
5. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 249.1553483245554 mg/g is elevated, suggesting kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Elevated potassium levels (5.23853965773999 mEq/L) can be associated with kidney dysfunction.
7. **Edema and Fatigue**: The presence of edema and a fatigue score of 6.048741293313153/10 may indicate fluid retention and poor overall health status, which can be related to kidney function.
8. **Medication Use**: The use of antidiabetic medications and NSAIDs (7.815667590268928 times/week) can impact kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use.
9. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI of 36.873485140066784, relatively low physical activity (0.6710846152635164 hours/week), and moderate alcohol consumption (5.048849260559352 units/week) contribute to the overall risk profile.

Despite some protective factors such as good water quality, no smoking, and a relatively high diet quality (6.833036526040215/10), the cumulative effect of the risk factors mentioned above leads to a significant risk score for chronic kidney disease.

The calculated risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and current health status. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), as diabetes is a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 147 mmHg is considered high and is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level of 101 mg/dL and HbA1c of 6.005% indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Albuminuria)**: The presence of 0.99859758504392 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **High BMI and Low Physical Activity**: A BMI of 36.873485140066784 and low physical activity level (0.6710846152635164 hours/week) contribute to an increased risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
6. **Medications and Electrolyte Balance**: The use of NSAIDs (7.815667590268928 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term use. Elevated potassium levels (5.23853965773999 mEq/L) also indicate a need for monitoring, as they can be a sign of reduced kidney function.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of edema, fatigue, and muscle cramps may be indicative of underlying kidney issues, although these symptoms can also be related to other conditions.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate the risk include:
- **Good Water Quality**: Exposure to good water quality reduces the risk of kidney damage from external toxins.
- **High Health Literacy and Medication Adherence**: Good understanding of health information and adherence to medication regimens can help manage risk factors and slow CKD progression.
- **Regular Medical Checkups**: Frequent medical checkups (1.3412791309513157 times/year) allow for early detection and management of any kidney problems.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is relatively high, considering several key factors:

- **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes reduces the risk, but other factors contribute to the increased score.
- **Lifestyle and Health**: A BMI of 32.79 indicates obesity, which is a risk factor. Moderate physical activity and relatively poor diet quality also contribute to the risk.
- **Medical History and Current Health**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching suggests kidney dysfunction. Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can impact kidney health.
- **Kidney Function**: The GFR is within the normal range, but the creatinine level is on the higher end, and there's a significant amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria), which is a key indicator of kidney damage.
- **Electrolytes and Lipids**: While most electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the total and LDL cholesterol levels are higher than ideal, contributing to cardiovascular risk, which is linked to kidney disease.
- **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors suggests hypertension management, which is crucial for kidney protection. However, the presence of frequent NSAID use can be harmful to kidney function.
- **Exposures and Behaviors**: Good water quality and lack of heavy metal or chemical exposure are positives, but low frequencies of medical checkups and moderate medication adherence are concerns.

Overall, while some risk factors are well-managed, the presence of significant proteinuria, symptoms suggestive of kidney dysfunction, and lifestyle factors contribute to an increased risk score for chronic kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 72/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to several factors. The main points are:
- Elevated creatinine level (3.25 mg/dL) and low GFR (21.73 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
- High proteinuria (4.98 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 184.07 mg/g suggest significant kidney damage.
- Presence of hypertension (systolic BP 154 mmHg), hyperglycemia (fasting glucose 150.17 mg/dL, HbA1c 8.63%), and dyslipidemia (high total and LDL cholesterol) are all risk factors for CKD progression.
- Reduced kidney function is also suggested by elevated BUN level (34.17 mg/dL) and electrolyte imbalances (high potassium and low calcium levels).
- The patient's lifestyle, including smoking, low physical activity, and poor diet quality, further contribute to the high risk of CKD progression.
- The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, are consistent with advanced CKD.
- Despite some positive health behaviors, such as regular medical checkups and statin use, the overall risk score is high due to the presence of multiple risk factors and indicators of kidney damage.",87,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 87/100**

- **Renal function**: GFR 21 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 4 CKD) and creatinine 3.25 mg/dL – already advanced disease.  
- **Proteinuria**: 4.98 g/day and ACR 184 mg/g – massive albumin excretion, a strong predictor of progression.  
- **Metabolic control**: HbA1c 8.6 % and fasting glucose >150 mg/dL indicate poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD worsening.  
- **Blood pressure**: 154/81 mmHg – systolic hypertension remains uncontrolled, accelerating renal damage.

The high risk score is primarily due to the following factors:
- Elevated creatinine levels (3.2538161434587742 mg/dL) and low GFR (21.728136778266403 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
- Presence of protein in urine (4.9831429771231095 g/day) and high ACR (184.0705411056391 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
- High systolic blood pressure (154 mmHg), fasting glucose (150.1743734102193 mg/dL), and HbA1c (8.628172498327753%) contribute to the risk, as hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for CKD.
- The patient's lifestyle factors, such as a high BMI (34.801114776224026), smoking, and relatively low physical activity (2.6800898368522352 hours/week), also increase the risk.
- Additionally, the patient's symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score (46.11502595466028/100), may be indicative of advanced kidney disease.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 88/100
Rationale
Renal function:
GFR at 21.7 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates stage 3b CKD.
Creatinine of 3.25 mg/dL and BUN of 34 mg/dL are markedly elevated.
Proteinuria 4.98 g/day and ACR 184 mg/g signify significant glomerular damage.
Metabolic comorbidities:
Fasting glucose 150 mg/dL and HbA1c 8.63 % reflect uncontrolled diabetes, a major CKD driver.
Hypertension (154/81 mmHg) further accelerates kidney decline.
Lifestyle risks:
BMI ≈ 35, smoking present, NSAID use ~ 5–6 times/week, and only 2.7 h of physical activity per week contribute to progressive renal injury.
Cardiovascular profile:
LDL ~ 199 mg/dL (borderline high) with decent HDL suggests ongoing atherosclerotic stress, which can worsen CKD.
Other factors:
Moderate diet quality and sleep quality, but low medication adherence (3.5/10) and limited health literacy may hinder optimal disease management.
Overall, the combination of advanced kidney impairment, significant proteinuria, uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, plus detrimental lifestyle habits yields a high chronic kidney disease risk score of 88/100.",88.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

The provided risk score is based on the combination of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered include:

1. **Family History**: No family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which reduces the risk.
2. **Medical History**: No previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) or Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), both of which can increase the risk of CKD.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 119 mmHg and Diastolic BP of 84 mmHg, both within normal ranges, reducing the risk.
4. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c**: Fasting glucose of 73.66 mg/dL and HbA1c of 4.44%, indicating good glucose control, which is beneficial.
5. **Kidney Function**: Creatinine of 3.90 mg/dL is slightly elevated but within the provided range, and GFR of 107.17 mL/min/1.73 m² is actually above the normal range (>90 mL/min/1.73 m²), suggesting good kidney function.
6. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: Protein in urine of 3.05 g/day and ACR of 221.33 mg/g, both of which are elevated and indicate potential kidney damage or disease.
7. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: mostly within normal ranges, though LDL cholesterol is slightly elevated, which could be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including those affecting kidney health.
8. **Medications**: Use of NSAIDs and antidiabetic medications; frequent NSAID use can be harmful to kidney function.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of edema, moderate levels of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, suggesting significant impact on daily living.
10. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Good water quality, no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, but relatively low adherence to medication and health literacy, which could impact management of CKD risk factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors, including:

* Elevated creatinine levels (3.902186271713476 mg/dL) and protein in urine (3.046122499617509 g/day), indicating impaired kidney function and potential kidney damage.
* High ACR (221.32700934350123 mg/g) values, suggesting significant proteinuria, a key marker of CKD.
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as high potassium (5.021432298038144 mEq/L) and phosphorus (4.330589600868807 mg/dL) levels, which can be indicative of kidney dysfunction.
* The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which are common symptoms of CKD.
* Medication non-adherence (2.0822838109862074/10) and low health literacy (0.7864716778168879/10) may also contribute to the increased risk score.
* The use of antidiabetic medications suggests that the patient may have diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD, although the patient's HbA1c and fasting glucose levels are within normal limits.

However, the patient's relatively preserved GFR (107.1672317952776 mL/min/1.73 m²), normal blood pressure, and lack of family history of kidney disease or hypertension are factors that mitigate the risk score.

2. **Medical History**: No previous acute kidney injury (AKI) or urinary tract infections (UTIs) is positive.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are within a relatively normal range, which is a good sign.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Indicate good glucose control, suggesting a lower risk of diabetic nephropathy.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: 
   - Elevated creatinine levels (3.902186271713476 mg/dL) and BUN (32.22507720133963 mg/dL) suggest impaired kidney function.
   - The GFR (107.1672317952776 mL/min/1.73 m²) is actually higher than normal, which might indicate hyperfiltration, a potential risk factor for CKD.
6. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: High levels (3.046122499617509 g/day and 221.32700934350123 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage.
7. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: Some values are near the upper limits of their ranges, which could indicate metabolic issues but are not directly strongly indicative of CKD risk.
8. **Medications**: Use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can increase the risk of CKD, and the presence of antidiabetic medication suggests diabetes management is necessary.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Presence of edema, significant fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, and a relatively low QoL score indicate current health issues that could be related to or exacerbate CKD.
10. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals are positives, but the frequency of medical checkups and medication adherence could be improved.

Given these factors, the risk score of 73/100 suggests a significant risk of developing or progressing chronic kidney disease, primarily due to indicators of impaired kidney function, presence of protein in the urine, and certain lifestyle and medication factors.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could lower the risk, the absence of these factors does not significantly reduce the risk given the presence of other contributing factors.
2. **Clinical Measurements**: The patient has a relatively normal systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and HbA1c, which are positive indicators. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the GFR, while within the normal range, suggests that kidney function is at the higher end of normal but could be indicative of hyperfiltration in some contexts.
3. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.046122499617509 g/day) and an elevated ACR (221.32700934350123 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage and increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The electrolyte levels are mostly within normal ranges, although potassium is at the higher end of normal. Hemoglobin is within the normal range, which is a positive indicator.
5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient's BMI is low, which could be either a positive factor if due to healthy lifestyle choices or a negative indicator if due to unintended weight loss. The lack of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption are positive factors. However, the diet quality and physical activity levels are relatively low, which could contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of antidiabetic medications despite normal glucose levels could indicate pre-diabetic conditions or insulin resistance, which increases the risk of CKD. Symptoms like edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score, suggest that there may be underlying issues affecting kidney function or overall health.
7. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups, moderate medication adherence, and limited health literacy could hinder the early detection and management of CKD, thereby increasing the risk.

Rationale
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Age
83 y
Older age is a major risk factor for progressive kidney decline.
Proteinuria
3.05 g/day
>3 g/day strongly indicates advanced nephropathy; correlates with rapid GFR loss.
Albumin‑creatinine ratio (ACR)
221 mg/g
>200 mg/g is considered high‑grade albuminuria, a hallmark of CKD.
Serum creatinine
3.90 mg/dL
Elevated creatinine suggests reduced filtration, though the reported GFR (107 mL/min/1.73 m²) may be underestimated due to calculation assumptions.
Blood pressure
119/84 mmHg
Within normal limits, but no ACE/ARB therapy which could protect remaining renal function.
NSAID use
4.2 × / wk
Frequent NSAID exposure aggravates renal perfusion loss and can worsen proteinuria.
Symptoms
Edema, fatigue, muscle cramps, itching
Classic manifestations of advanced CKD and electrolyte disturbance.
Lifestyle
Low diet quality (2.4/10) & limited physical activity (~2.8 h/wk)
Contribute to metabolic stress and potential worsening of renal function.
Comorbidities
None reported for diabetes/hypertension; but hyperlipidemia present
Atherosclerotic disease may compound renal microvascular damage.
Combining these elements, the overall CKD risk is moderate‑to‑high (≈80 %). Monitoring, nephrology referral, and interventions to reduce proteinuria and NSAID exposure are strongly recommended.",78.0,African American,Hispanic

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family history increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a significant risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI is a known risk factor for the development of CKD, indicating that the kidneys have previously been under significant stress.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: The high creatinine level (4.53828502413536 mg/dL) and low GFR (38.7150860945971 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function, which are direct markers of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.126761064159882 g/day) and a high ACR (119.35923905945856 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.
5. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is elevated (93/108 mmHg), suggesting that blood pressure management might be a concern, and uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The elevated fasting glucose (128.96249186304584 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.747132012658398%) levels suggest poor glucose control, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for patients with CKD or at risk of CKD to slow disease progression, indicates a proactive approach to managing risk factors but also suggests the presence of conditions that necessitate such intervention.

While lifestyle factors such as diet quality, physical activity, and alcohol consumption also play a role, the presence of significant medical history and current indicators of kidney function and damage sway the risk score towards a higher value. Regular medical checkups, adherence to medication, and health literacy are positive factors but are overshadowed by the aforementioned risk factors in determining the overall risk score.",87,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

**Brief rationale**

- **Advanced age (74 yrs)** and **Black race** – both increase susceptibility to CKD progression.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Pre-existing Conditions**: The presence of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and a family history of hypertension are significant risk factors for CKD.
2. **Renal Function**: The elevated creatinine level (4.53828502413536 mg/dL) and reduced estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR of 38.7150860945971 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
3. **Proteinuria**: The high amount of protein in the urine (4.126761064159882 g/day) and the Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 119.35923905945856 mg/g are indicators of kidney damage.
4. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated (93/108 mmHg), which can be harmful to kidney health over time.
5. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated fasting glucose (128.96249186304584 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.747132012658398%) levels suggest poor glycemic control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (30.905470716733618) and moderate alcohol consumption (10.286418647818229 units/week) may also contribute to the risk of CKD progression.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD patients, but the occasional use of NSAIDs (4.193242374937723 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function and may contribute to the risk score.

These factors collectively indicate a high risk for chronic kidney disease, suggesting the need for close monitoring and management of the condition to prevent further progression.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and diabetes increases the risk.
2. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated creatinine (1.324 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (42.93 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. High levels of protein in urine (3.79 g/day) and ACR (292.35 mg/g) are also indicative of kidney damage.
3. **Blood Pressure and Glucose Control**: High systolic blood pressure (152 mmHg) and elevated fasting glucose (183.33 mg/dL) along with HbA1c (8.68%) suggest poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
4. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some electrolytes are within normal ranges, the presence of high total cholesterol (221.45 mg/dL) can contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is closely linked to CKD.
5. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, but also suggests the presence of conditions that increase CKD risk. Symptoms like fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps can be associated with CKD and its complications.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Low diet quality (1.28/10) and relatively low physical activity (4.56 hours/week) may contribute to the risk by affecting overall health and disease management.

Overall, the combination of genetic predisposition, indicators of kidney damage, poor control of blood pressure and glucose, and lifestyle factors contribute to a high risk score for CKD.",87,African American,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 82/100

4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.1755436634544836 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 146 mmHg is elevated, and hypertension is a well-established risk factor for CKD.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate existing kidney issues or hypertension, which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the patient does not smoke and has a moderate level of physical activity, the low diet quality and high alcohol consumption may contribute to the risk of CKD.

Current eGFR places you in a high‑risk category
Albuminuria / proteinuria (ACR ≈ 289 mg/g, protein ≈ 2.2 g/day)
>1 g/day and ACR >300 mg/g strongly predict decline
Your values are near the upper limit of normal
Hypertension (SBP 146 mmHg)
Systolic >140 mmHg contributes to renal damage
You have sustained mild‑to‑moderate elevation
Diabetes / glycemic control (HbA1c 9.16 %)
Poor glycemic control accelerates CKD
No antidiabetic therapy yet; high HbA1c indicates significant hyperglycaemia
NSAID use (~9 ×/week)
Repeated nephrotoxic exposure
High frequency increases risk of further kidney injury
Socioeconomic status / health literacy
Low scores limit access to care, medication adherence, diet
Low SES and modest health literacy can hinder disease management
Lifestyle (low BMI, moderate exercise, modest alcohol)
Under‑weight may reduce metabolic burden, but low diet quality (1.9/10) can worsen outcomes
Diet quality is poor, potentially contributing to dyslipidemia and protein loss
Comorbidities (high triglycerides, borderline LDL)
Dyslipidemia exacerbates atherosclerosis → renal vascular injury
Elevated lipid profile may worsen cardiovascular and renal risk
Combining these elements—advanced CKD stage, significant proteinuria, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, frequent NSAID use, and socioeconomic/behavioral risk factors—places you in the high‑risk category for progressive kidney disease.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Elevated HbA1c**: An HbA1c level of 9.16270441399806% indicates poor glycemic control, which can damage kidney function over time.
3. **Low GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 27.975700041190812 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly below the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.1755436634544836 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 146 mmHg is elevated, and hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
6. **Medications and Lifestyle**: While the use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, the frequent use of NSAIDs (8.961766327145277 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
7. **Poor Diet Quality**: A diet quality score of 1.8798387207603384/10 may indicate inadequate intake of essential nutrients and excessive intake of harmful substances, potentially exacerbating kidney disease.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk of progressing to more severe stages of CKD or experiencing kidney failure. Early intervention, lifestyle modifications, and strict adherence to medication regimens are crucial to mitigate this risk.",83,Asian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 84/100
Rationale – Key points driving the score
Factor
Value
Why it matters for CKD risk
eGFR
27.98 mL/min/1.73 m²
Stage 3b CKD; already indicates moderate to severe loss of renal function.
Proteinuria & ACR
2.18 g/day & 289 mg/g
Persistent albuminuria (ACR > 300 mg/g is threshold) is a powerful predictor of progression.
Blood pressure
146/60 mmHg
Systolic > 140 mmHg raises risk, especially with diuretic/NSAID use.
Glycemic control
HbA1c = 9.16 %
Poorly controlled diabetes accelerates CKD progression; family history of diabetes adds baseline risk.
Medication profile
ACE‑inhibitor + diuretic + NSAID 9 ×/week
ACEi protects kidneys but NSAIDs can worsen renal perfusion; frequent NSAID use increases acute injury risk.
Lifestyle
BMI ≈ 18.2 (low), diet score 1.88/10, sleep 7/10
Poor diet quality and low BMI suggest nutritional deficits that may impair recovery.
Lipid profile
Triglycerides ≈ 360 mg/dL, LDL ≈ 182 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to vascular disease and can exacerbate renal injury.
Socio‑economic & literacy
Low SES, health literacy 2.6/10
Limits access to care and optimal self‑management of CKD risk factors.
Other labs
Creatinine 1.30 mg/dL, BUN 10 mg/dL
Supports decreased filtration.
Symptoms
Fatigue (5.6/10), nausea/vomiting (5.7 ×/week), muscle cramps (6.9 ×/week)
Reflect functional burden and potential electrolyte disturbances.
Taken together, these variables place the individual in a high‑risk category for CKD progression. A score of 84/100 reflects the combination of advanced eGFR impairment, significant proteinuria, poor glycemic control, and behavioral/lifestyle factors that heighten the likelihood of further renal decline.",84.0,Asian,Hispanic

The provided risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the given medical history and lifestyle information. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 88 mmHg indicate hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 106.02856940534453 mg/dL suggests impaired fasting glucose, which can be a precursor to diabetes and, by extension, increases the risk of CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 66.7954883148787 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal to mildly decreased range, when considered in the context of other factors, contributes to the overall risk assessment.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 4.76515209231618 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant indicator of kidney damage and a strong predictor of CKD progression.
6. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, along with high triglycerides, can contribute to vascular diseases, including CKD.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The relatively low diet quality, moderate alcohol consumption, and NSAID use, although not excessively high, contribute to the risk when combined with other factors.
8. **Health Behaviors**: Infrequent medical checkups, moderate medication adherence, and limited health literacy may hinder the early detection and management of CKD, thus increasing the risk.

These factors collectively contribute to a heightened risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the absence of previous AKI, UTIs, and certain other risk factors, along with good water quality and the lack of exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, prevent the risk score from being even higher.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
- **Existing Kidney Issues**: Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury), UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections), and a family history of diabetes, which can all contribute to or exacerbate CKD.
- **Blood Pressure and Glucose Levels**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (158 mmHg) and fasting glucose levels (104.875 mg/dL), along with an HbA1c of 9.748%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
- **Kidney Function**: Low GFR (22.103 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (2.732 mg/dL) and BUN (17.366 mg/dL) levels suggest compromised kidney function.
- **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.905 g/day) with an ACR of 152.677 mg/g, which is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
- **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: Abnormal levels of certain electrolytes and high total cholesterol (257.837 mg/dL) and triglycerides (262.922 mg/dL) can further stress kidney function.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Poor diet quality (2.738/10), high BMI (36.11), and relatively low physical activity (6.91 hours/week) contribute to the risk.
- **Medications and Compliance**: The use of statins is beneficial for cholesterol management, but the lack of ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which are often used to manage conditions related to CKD, and occasional use of NSAIDs, which can be harmful to kidney function, are noted.
- **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: Significant fatigue (8.436/10), occasional nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a compromised QoL score (74.88/100), suggest that CKD is already impacting daily life.
- **Exposures**: Poor water quality could potentially expose you to harmful substances that might affect kidney health.

Given these factors, it is crucial to closely monitor kidney function, adjust medications under medical supervision, and make significant lifestyle changes to mitigate the risk of CKD progression.",87,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

**Brief Rationale**

| Key Risk Factor | How it Contributes to CKD Risk |

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

* Existing family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing CKD
* Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), indicating compromised renal function
* Presence of UTIs, which can lead to CKD if not properly managed
* Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c levels, suggesting poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD
* Low GFR (22.10388445531114 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function
* High levels of protein in urine (0.9056750480419606 g/day) and ACR (152.67730059859852 mg/g), signifying kidney damage
* Elevated Creatinine levels (2.732065453649561 mg/dL) further confirming impaired kidney function
* Existing comorbidities, such as high blood pressure (158/64 mmHg) and high total cholesterol (257.8367720508867 mg/dL), which can exacerbate CKD
* Poor diet quality (2.738206192862208/10) and low physical activity (6.913498642761624 hours/week), contributing to the progression of CKD
* The presence of symptoms such as fatigue (8.43646554009774/10) and muscle cramps (0.9946898041164716 times/week), which can be associated with CKD.

* High fasting glucose (165.48718065559 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.049114488316096%) levels indicate poor blood sugar control, which is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Reduced kidney function, as indicated by a creatinine level of 3.595923068033978 mg/dL and a GFR of 66.85162926864251 mL/min/1.73 m², suggests existing kidney damage.
* Presence of protein in the urine (2.5535913895643243 g/day) and an elevated ACR (6.186322958071244 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
* Family history of hypertension and exposure to heavy metals and occupational chemicals may also contribute to the risk of CKD.
* The patient's high BMI, although within the underweight range, combined with a relatively low diet quality and high alcohol consumption, may further increase the risk.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and laboratory results. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (168/90 mmHg), indicating hypertension, a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Family history of hypertension, which increases the likelihood of developing CKD.
* High fasting glucose level (165.48718065559 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.049114488316096%), indicating poor glucose control, a risk factor for CKD.
* Elevated creatinine level (3.595923068033978 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (66.85162926864251 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (2.5535913895643243 g/day) and high ACR (6.186322958071244 mg/g), indicating kidney damage.
* History of diuretic use and frequent NSAID use (8.124204632166663 times/week), which can exacerbate kidney damage.
* Poor symptoms and quality of life (QoL) scores, including fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, and itching, which may be related to CKD.
* Exposure to heavy metals and occupational chemicals, which can increase the risk of CKD.

However, some factors reduce the risk score, such as:
* High socioeconomic status and education level, which may indicate better access to healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices.
* Good water quality and relatively high health literacy (7.269708875093713/10), which may facilitate healthier behaviors.
* Regular medical checkups (3.585253786669215/year) and moderate medication adherence (4.0517864043553695/10), which may help manage underlying conditions.

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive data shared, which includes demographic, lifestyle, medical history, and clinical parameters. The main points that contribute to this high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors compensates for this in the risk assessment.
2. **Clinical Parameters**:
   - **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (164/112 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
   - **Glucose Levels**: High fasting glucose (172.1819251528963 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.722215053171658%) levels indicate poor glycemic control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
   - **Kidney Function**: Reduced GFR (55.35678510613568 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (0.929479818314004 mg/dL) and BUN (29.555443212645212 mg/dL) levels suggest impaired kidney function.
   - **Proteinuria**: Presence of protein in urine (2.123353873126634 g/day) with a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (271.386114081026 mg/g) is indicative of kidney damage.
3. **Lifestyle and Exposures**:
   - **Physical Activity**: While physical activity (9.086107377996054 hours/week) is relatively high, the overall lifestyle factors such as diet quality (6.014265852248007/10) and sleep quality (7.448831349233684/10) could be improved.
   - **Exposure to Heavy Metals**: Exposure to heavy metals can be harmful to kidney function and contributes to the risk score.
4. **Medications and Health Behaviors**:
   - The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics indicates management of hypertension and possibly CKD, but NSAIDs use (3.8642656065641177 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
   - Low adherence to medication (6.048345440026614/10) and moderate health literacy (5.255740434373388/10) might hinder effective disease management.

The provided data indicates a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for several key reasons:

1. **Family History and Medical Conditions**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of high blood pressure (164/112 mmHg) and elevated fasting glucose (172.1819251528963 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.722215053171658%) levels are significant risk factors for CKD.

2. **Kidney Function**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 55.35678510613568 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range (which is typically considered to be 90 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher), indicating impaired kidney function. The elevated creatinine (0.929479818314004 mg/dL) and BUN (29.555443212645212 mg/dL) levels also suggest kidney dysfunction.

3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (2.123353873126634 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 271.386114081026 mg/g are indicators of kidney damage, a key factor in the development of CKD.

4. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: While the electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, the hemoglobin level (14.59623470243365 g/dL) is at the higher end of the normal range, which could be a compensatory response to anemia associated with CKD, although not definitively indicative on its own.

5. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests management of hypertension and possibly proteinuria, which are common in CKD. Exposure to heavy metals and poor water quality can also contribute to kidney damage.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, and a reduced quality of life score (56.61798303301319/100) are all consistent with advanced kidney disease.

7. **Health Behaviors**: The frequency of medical checkups, medication adherence, and health literacy, while important for overall health management, do not directly influence the risk score for CKD as much as the other",87,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

The rationale for this risk score is based on several key factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which are common risk factors, the presence of other significant risk factors compensates for this in the risk assessment.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (164/112 mmHg) are significantly elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (172.1819251528963 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.722215053171658%) are elevated, suggesting poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 55.35678510613568 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.123353873126634 g/day) and an elevated ACR (271.386114081026 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.

The risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Main points include:

- **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease increases the risk.
- **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (141/92 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
- **Fasting Glucose**: A value of 140.18872859205467 mg/dL indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation, which can contribute to kidney damage over time.
- **Kidney Function Tests**: A creatinine level of 2.629808317858489 mg/dL and a GFR of 107.61018818254112 mL/min/1.73 m² are within a range that may not immediately indicate severe kidney impairment but warrant monitoring, especially considering other risk factors.
- **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.3983618505043185 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
- **Electrolytes and Other Labs**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, the overall metabolic profile, including cholesterol and triglycerides, suggests a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, which are closely linked with CKD.
- **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for controlling blood pressure and protecting kidney function, but NSAID use, even at a rate of 5.95785683425769 times/week, can be harmful to kidney function.
- **Lifestyle and Exposures**: Poor water quality and relatively low physical activity levels, along with a diet quality score of 4.267909701745195/10, contribute to the risk.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score, suggests that kidney function may already be impacted.

Considering these factors, the calculated risk score reflects a significant likelihood of developing or progressing CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to prescribed treatments to mitigate risk factors.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 85/100**

**Rationale (key points):**

1. **Renal function markers** – Elevated serum creatinine (2.63 mg/dL) and significant proteinuria (3.4 g/day, ACR 218 mg/g) strongly indicate existing kidney damage, driving a high CKD risk.  
2. **Blood pressure** – Systolic/diastolic 141/92 mmHg is above the normal range, and chronic hypertension is a major CKD driver.  
3. **Glucose metabolism** – Fasting glucose 140 mg/dL (pre‑diabetes level) and a borderline HbA1c (4.4 %) suggest early metabolic derangements that can accelerate kidney decline.  
4. **Family history & medication** – Positive family history of kidney disease and use of an ACE‑inhibitor imply both genetic susceptibility and early therapeutic response to a kidney‑protective drug.  
5. **Lifestyle factors** – BMI ~27, moderate alcohol intake, and relatively low physical activity contribute to metabolic stress on the kidneys.  
6. **Other biomarkers** – Elevated LDL cholesterol (131 mg/dL) and high total cholesterol (291 mg/dL) add cardiovascular risk, often accompanying CKD progression.  

Combining these indicators, the patient is at **moderate‑to‑high** risk for chronic kidney disease progression, hence an 85/100 score.",85.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

* Family history of kidney disease, which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Elevated systolic blood pressure (141 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (92 mmHg), which can damage kidneys over time
* High fasting glucose level (140.18 mg/dL) and HbA1c (4.41%), indicating impaired glucose regulation
* Elevated creatinine level (2.63 mg/dL) and protein in urine (3.40 g/day), suggesting kidney damage or decreased kidney function
* ACE inhibitor use, which may indicate existing kidney issues or hypertension
* Poor water quality, which can increase the risk of kidney disease due to potential contaminants
* Suboptimal diet quality (4.27/10) and physical activity (3.99 hours/week), which can contribute to kidney disease risk factors like hypertension and diabetes
* History of NSAIDs use (5.96 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and worsen kidney function

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

- **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A serum creatinine level of 4.385107083231239 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
- **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.7523744736408022 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
- **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 1.792452217780971 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as it indicates the presence of albumin (a protein) in the urine, which healthy kidneys would normally prevent.
- **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: Although the GFR is 77.29020470914465 mL/min/1.73 m², which falls within the normal range, the context of other abnormal kidney function markers suggests that this might not accurately reflect the overall kidney health.
- **Family History and Medical Conditions**: While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors and current kidney function indicators dominates the risk assessment.
- **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: Factors such as low diet quality, minimal physical activity, and the presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching also contribute to the overall risk, as these can impact kidney health and are associated with CKD progression or complications.
- **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can have implications for kidney function, especially in the context of existing kidney issues.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, indicating the need for close monitoring, potential adjustment of medications, and lifestyle modifications to mitigate risk factors and slow CKD progression.",87,African American,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 84/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily based on the following key factors:
1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.385107083231239 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as it is above the normal range.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.7523744736408022 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
3. **GFR**: Although the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 77.29020470914465 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, the other indicators of kidney function and damage suggest that this value might not fully capture the extent of kidney impairment.
4. **Family History and Comorbidities**: While there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the high fasting glucose level (189.83284356210248 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.63714628224859%) suggest the presence of diabetes or prediabetes, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
5. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 157 mmHg is elevated, which can both be a cause and a consequence of CKD.
6. **Lifestyle and Diet**: A low diet quality score (1.2221158358536732/10) and relatively low physical activity (1.583730205292002 hours/week) may contribute to the progression of CKD.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, along with symptoms like itching (which could indicate uremia) and fatigue, further support the likelihood of significant kidney issues.

Given these factors, despite some indicators being within normal ranges, the overall profile suggests a high risk for CKD, warranting close monitoring and potentially more aggressive management of risk factors and symptoms.",83,African American,Asian,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

- The presence of certain symptoms like itching (8.119147389555101/10) and decreased quality of life (QoL Score: 52.69500770175879/100) may be related to CKD progression.
- Despite the absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the current clinical and laboratory findings strongly suggest a significant risk for CKD.",82,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 85/100
Rationale
Age & Race – At 88 yrs and Black, baseline CKD risk is elevated.
Renal Function Indicators –
Creatinine of 4.38 mg/dL and proteinuria 2.75 g/day are far above normal, suggesting significant structural damage despite a GFR of 77 mL/min/1.73 m².
GFR in the 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m² range (CKD Stage 2) still carries a high long‑term risk when accompanied by heavy proteinuria.
Blood Pressure – Systolic 157 mm Hg indicates uncontrolled hypertension, a primary driver of CKD progression.
Metabolic Control – Fasting glucose 190 mg/dL and HbA1c 8.6 % confirm diabetes, which accelerates renal decline.
NSAID Use – ~3 times/week can worsen kidney perfusion, especially in someone already having reduced function.
Lifestyle & Symptoms – Low BMI, poor diet quality, moderate activity, and high fatigue/itching reflect malnutrition and advanced disease burden, further compounding risk.
Medication Profile – Absence of renoprotective agents (ACEi/ARB, statins) and use of diuretics (which may exacerbate volume status) add to vulnerability.
Taken together, the combination of advanced age, racial predisposition, significant proteinuria, poor metabolic control, and ongoing nephrotoxic medication use places this individual in a high‑risk category for chronic kidney disease progression. The score of 85/100 reflects that high probability of further decline and the need for urgent nephrology referral and comprehensive management.",85.0,African American,Black

The provided information suggests a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this assessment include:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.385107083231239 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating reduced kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 2.7523744736408022 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage.
3. **GFR**: Although the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 77.29020470914465 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range, when considered in the context of other indicators such as elevated creatinine and proteinuria, it suggests that kidney function is compromised.
4. **Hypertension**: A systolic blood pressure of 157 mmHg indicates hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
5. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 189.83284356210248 mg/dL and 8.63714628224859%, respectively, suggest poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
6. **Family History and Other Medical Conditions**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of other risk factors such as elevated blood pressure and glucose levels contributes to the overall risk.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The low diet quality, high alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity may further contribute to the risk of CKD progression.

These factors collectively indicate a high risk for chronic kidney disease. Management of hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle modifications are crucial to slowing the progression of CKD.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 73 out of 100, indicating a high risk. This assessment is based on several key factors:

1. **High Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.09956767274149 mg/dL is significantly elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.616216631808888 g/day of protein in the urine is a strong indicator of kidney damage.
3. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 123.95185957395591 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage.
4. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no reported family history of kidney disease, the absence of other familial conditions (hypertension, diabetes) doesn't significantly mitigate the current indicators of kidney issues.
5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: While some lifestyle factors such as no smoking and good sleep quality are positive, the high BMI (38.784909312110386), moderate alcohol consumption (14.63215888737048 units/week), and relatively low diet quality (2.664598216464947/10) contribute to the risk.
6. **Medical History and Current Health**: The history of UTIs and the current high systolic blood pressure (149 mmHg) are also contributing factors to the risk of CKD.
7. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated BUN (47.118031034233645 mg/dL) and changes in electrolyte levels, such as sodium and potassium, also point towards kidney function impairment.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.09956767274149 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as normal ranges are typically between 0.5 and 1.2 mg/dL for adult males, though this can vary by lab. Your level is significantly higher, suggesting severe kidney impairment.

2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.616216631808888 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a significant indicator of kidney damage. Normally, the kidneys filter waste while keeping proteins and other necessary nutrients in the blood. When kidneys are damaged, they are less efficient at filtering waste and may allow proteins to leak into the urine.

3. **ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 123.95185957395591 mg/g is high, which further supports the presence of kidney damage. ACR is a measure that compares the amount of albumin (a type of protein) to creatinine in the urine, and high levels are associated with kidney disease.

4. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although you do not have a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which are common risk factors for CKD, other factors in your profile compensate for this lack of risk.

5. **Blood Pressure**: Your systolic blood pressure is elevated at 149 mmHg. Hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease because it increases the pressure on blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to potential damage over time.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Your high BMI (38.784909312110386), indicating obesity, and low diet quality (2.664598216464947/10) are also risk factors for CKD. Obesity can increase the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which are major risk factors for kidney disease.

7. **Limited Physical Activity**: Although you have some level of physical activity (4.700202095726968 hours/week), it may not be sufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of your high BMI and poor diet quality.

Despite having some protective factors, such as no smoking and good sleep quality, the presence of significant kidney impairment indicators (elevated creatinine, proteinuria, high ACR,",74,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

**Rationale**

- **Proteinuria & ACR** – 3.6 g/day and an ACR of 124 mg/g are strong indicators of kidney damage and independently predict CKD progression.  
- **Hypertension** – Systolic BP of 149 mmHg is above normal and contributes to ongoing renal insult.  
- **Obesity** – BMI ≈ 38 is a major risk factor for both hypertension and kidney injury.

The provided patient data indicates a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this assessment include:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.09956767274149 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.616216631808888 g/day of protein in the urine is a strong indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
3. **High ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio)**: An ACR of 123.95185957395591 mg/g suggests significant kidney damage, as it indicates a high level of albumin (a protein) in the urine relative to the creatinine level.
4. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) could imply a predisposition to kidney issues.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the patient has a high BMI, indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for CKD, the patient also has a high level of physical activity and good sleep quality, which are protective factors. However, the diet quality is relatively low, which could contribute to CKD risk.
6. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure is elevated at 149 mmHg, which is a risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage kidneys over time.
7. **Electrolyte and Mineral Levels**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within normal ranges, which is positive, but the overall kidney function indicators suggest a high risk of CKD.
8. **Lipid Profile**: The patient has high total cholesterol and triglycerides, which can contribute to cardiovascular disease, a major comorbidity with CKD.
9. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can impair kidney function over time. Good medication adherence and regular medical checkups are positive factors but may not fully mitigate the CKD risk given the other indicators.

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. Main points include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure (137/90 mmHg) is elevated, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Elevated HbA1c (9.94%)**: Indicates poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for kidney disease, even though there's no family history of diabetes.
4. **Protein in Urine (3.30 g/day) and High ACR (168.99 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a significant risk factor for CKD, indicating kidney damage.
5. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Both are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which can indirectly affect kidney health.
6. **Low Diet Quality (2.68/10) and Low Physical Activity (1.78 hours/week)**: These lifestyle factors can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which are risk factors for CKD.
7. **Exposure to Heavy Metals and Poor Water Quality**: Both can be nephrotoxic and contribute to CKD risk.
8. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: While the use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for blood pressure control, the frequency of NSAIDs use could potentially be harmful to kidney function over time.

However, factors such as relatively preserved GFR (104.04 mL/min/1.73 m²), normal electrolyte levels, and no previous history of AKI or UTIs slightly mitigate the risk.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 73/100

The risk score is calculated based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for developing hypertension, which is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 137 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg indicate hypertension, a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Fasting glucose of 100.84 mg/dL and HbA1c of 9.94% suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD.
4. **Elevated Creatinine and Protein in Urine**: A creatinine level of 1.55 mg/dL and significant proteinuria (3.30 g/day) are direct indicators of kidney dysfunction.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, high alcohol consumption (14.97 units/week), and a relatively low level of physical activity (1.78 hours/week) contribute to the risk.
6. **Diet Quality and Sleep Quality**: A diet quality score of 2.68/10 and good sleep quality (8.61/10) have opposing effects on the risk, but the poor diet quality may negatively impact kidney health.
7. **Medications and Electrolytes**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the high levels of potassium (5.07 mEq/L) and phosphorus (4.34 mg/dL) could be indicative of kidney issues.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced QoL score (52.77/100), suggest significant kidney-related morbidity.
9. **Exposures to Heavy Metals and Poor Water Quality**: These environmental exposures can contribute to kidney damage.
10. **Health Behaviors**: While medication adherence is good (4.35/10), the frequency of medical checkups (2.73/year) and health literacy (6.73/10) could be improved to better manage kidney health.

These factors cumulatively indicate a high risk for CKD",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 72/100
Rationale – Key risk contributors
Factor
Why it raises CKD risk
Proteinuria (3.3 g/day) & ACR 169 mg/g
Persistent albumin/protein in urine is one of the most powerful predictors of progressive kidney disease, even when eGFR is normal.
Hypertension family history & borderline systolic BP (137 mmHg)
Family predisposition + early‑stage hypertension accelerates glomerular damage.
HbA1c 9.94 % & fasting glucose 101 mg/dL
Indicates impaired glucose tolerance/early diabetes, which independently accelerates CKD.
Elevated potassium (5.07 mEq/L)
Suggests early tubular dysfunction, often accompanying progressive renal injury.
Smoking, alcohol 15 units/week, NSAIDs ~1.5 ×/wk
These exposures add nephrotoxic burden and vascular damage.
High total cholesterol (264 mg/dL), low HDL (25 mg/dL)
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerotic renal vascular disease.
Heavy‑metal exposure + poor water quality
Environmental toxins can cause tubular and glomerular injury.
Edema, itching, muscle cramps, low medication adherence (4.3/10)
Symptom burden and suboptimal control of medications (ACEi, statin) hint at ongoing organ stress and potential progression.
Although the eGFR is currently within normal limits (GFR=104 mL/min/1.73 m²), the combination of high proteinuria, poor glucose control, hypertension predisposition, and multiple nephrotoxic exposures places this patient at a moderately‑high risk of future CKD progression, warranting close monitoring and aggressive risk factor management.",72.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

Adds ~10 pts for vascular damage.
NSAID use (2.6 ×/week)
↑
Potential nephrotoxic exposure; adds ~5 pts.
BMI (18.2)
Low
Low BMI may mitigate some risk but also signals possible malnutrition; neutral effect.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated creatinine levels (3.45 mg/dL) and protein in urine (2.43 g/day), indicating impaired kidney function.
* History of UTIs, which can increase the risk of chronic kidney disease.
* Family history of kidney disease is negative, but other factors such as age (85 years), low socioeconomic status, and smoking contribute to the risk.
* Elevated fasting glucose (151.22 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.73%) levels, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can affect kidney health.
* Use of ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial for kidney health, but also suggests that the patient has hypertension or kidney disease.
* Poor health behaviors, such as low medication adherence (0.88/10) and health literacy (2.71/10), may negatively impact kidney health management.
* The patient's BMI is low (18.17), which may indicate malnutrition or other health issues that can affect kidney function.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 149 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 102 mmHg indicate poorly controlled hypertension, which can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Abnormal Kidney Function Tests**: The elevated creatinine level (4.283 mg/dL) and low GFR (30.524 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function.
4. **Presence of Protein in Urine**: Proteinuria (1.227 g/day) is a sign of kidney damage and a risk factor for CKD progression.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The low potassium level (3.97 mEq/L) and slightly elevated phosphorus level (3.753 mg/dL) may indicate electrolyte disturbances, which can worsen kidney function.
6. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated fasting glucose (171.405 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.544%) levels indicate poor glucose control, which can contribute to CKD development and progression.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may be beneficial for blood pressure control, but NSAIDs can worsen kidney function, especially with frequent use (6.469 times/week).
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI (37.696), low physical activity (4.106 hours/week), and poor diet quality (1.508/10) contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue (8.599/10), nausea/vomiting (4.007 times/week), and itching (3.327/10) may indicate uremic symptoms, which can occur in advanced CKD.

Overall, the combination of these factors suggests a high risk of CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and optimized management of blood pressure, glucose, and electrolytes to slow disease progression.",87,Asian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 83/100
Rationale (key points)
Severe CKD stage – GFR <35 mL/min/1.73 m² and creatinine >4 mg/dL strongly indicate advanced kidney disease.
Uncontrolled diabetes – Fasting glucose 171 mg/dL and HbA1c 9.5 % elevate the likelihood of diabetic nephropathy.
Hypertension – Systolic/diastolic BP 149/102 mmHg, coupled with ACE‑inhibitor therapy, shows ongoing pressure‑related kidney damage.
Marked albuminuria – ACR 142 mg/g (moderate‑to‑severe) and proteinuria 1.23 g/day are classic CKD progression markers.
Obesity (BMI ≈38) – Adiposity contributes to glomerular hyperfiltration and cardiovascular risk.
Poor diet quality (1.5/10) and high alcohol use (≈15 units/week) add metabolic strain.
NSAID use 6–7 × week can further impair renal perfusion.
Low health literacy (1.4/10) and moderate medication adherence (4.9/10) may limit effective disease management.
Lipid abnormalities (high LDL 190 mg/dL, low HDL 20 mg/dL, triglycerides 377 mg/dL) increase vascular risk, compounding CKD progression.
All these factors combine to place the patient at a high risk of CKD progression and related morbidity—hence the score above 80 out of 100.",83.0,Asian,Caucasian

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely due to several key factors in your profile:
1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Your systolic and diastolic blood pressures are high (149/102 mmHg), which can damage kidneys over time and is a significant risk factor for developing CKD.
3. **High Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: Your fasting glucose (171.4054269587794 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.544540779581618%) levels indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or pre-diabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.
4. **Low GFR**: Your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 30.524767236248273 mL/min/1.73 m², which indicates impaired kidney function. A GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is a diagnostic criterion for CKD.
5. **Presence of Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: You have a significant amount of protein in your urine (1.227316290097205 g/day), which is a marker of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances and Abnormal Lipid Profile**: Your levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and particularly the abnormal lipid profile (high total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), can indicate or contribute to kidney dysfunction.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle Factors**: While you are on ACE inhibitors and diuretics, which are used to manage conditions related to CKD, your use of NSAIDs and the presence of obesity (BMI 37.69681692338102) also pose risks to kidney health.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Your symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a low QoL score, may reflect the impact of CKD on your overall health and well-being.

The provided risk score is based on the extensive medical history, lifestyle, and current health condition data. The key factors contributing to this high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: While there's no family history of kidney disease or diabetes, the presence of hypertension in the family is a significant risk factor, as hypertension is a leading cause of CKD.

2. **High Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (149/102 mmHg) are significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage kidneys over time.

3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: With a fasting glucose level of 171.4054269587794 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 9.544540779581618%, there's an indication of poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD.

4. **Reduced GFR and Elevated Creatinine**: A GFR of 30.524767236248273 mL/min/1.73 m² and a creatinine level of 4.283219564187995 mg/dL indicate impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.

5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of 1.227316290097205 g/day of protein in the urine, along with an ACR of 142.52577256820834 mg/g, signifies kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.

6. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests management of hypertension and possibly CKD, but the frequency of NSAIDs (6.469613199464877 times/week) could potentially exacerbate kidney damage due to their nephrotoxic effects.

7. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The low diet quality score (1.5082943766102863/10) and moderate physical activity level (4.106762482827003 hours/week) may contribute to the risk, as a healthy diet and regular physical activity are crucial for maintaining kidney health.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

* **Low GFR (18.98 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: Indicates impaired kidney function, which is a key indicator of CKD.
* **High Creatinine (4.82 mg/dL)**: Elevated creatinine levels suggest reduced kidney function and are a strong predictor of CKD.
* **Protein in urine (1.22 g/day) and high ACR (279.12 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a marker of kidney damage, and the high ACR further supports the presence of kidney disease.
* **History of UTIs**: Recurrent UTIs can increase the risk of CKD, especially if they involve the upper urinary tract.
* **Elevated Fasting Glucose (170.29 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.58%)**: Although there is no reported family history of diabetes, the current glucose levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD progression.
* **Hypertension**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is elevated, which can still contribute to kidney damage over time.
* **Medication use**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can be nephrotoxic and contribute to CKD progression, especially in the absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors.
* **Low socioeconomic status and moderate health literacy**: These factors can affect access to healthcare, medication adherence, and overall health behaviors, potentially worsening CKD outcomes.

However, factors that slightly mitigate the risk include:
* **No family history of kidney disease or hypertension**: This reduces the likelihood of genetic predispositions to CKD.
* **Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals**: These reduce the risk of environmental toxins contributing to CKD.
* **High HDL cholesterol and statin use**: These factors can help mitigate cardiovascular risk, which is often comorbid with CKD.

Overall, the combination of impaired kidney function, kidney damage markers, and other comorbid conditions (like impaired glucose regulation) significantly increases the risk of chronic kidney disease.",87,African American,Caucasian,"Risk Score: **88/100**

The risk score is based on the provided data, which indicates several factors that contribute to a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this score include:

1. **Existing Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient has a low GFR (18.97645598300223 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. The creatinine level is high (4.815531548090488 mg/dL), and there is a significant amount of protein in the urine (1.2179697802860638 g/day), suggesting substantial kidney damage.

2. **Diabetes Indicators**: The patient has elevated fasting glucose (170.28900090792433 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.575891557284804%) levels, which are indicative of uncontrolled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.

3. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated (116 mmHg), which can contribute to kidney strain and CKD progression.

4. **Lifestyle and Medical History**: The patient's low physical activity level, moderate alcohol consumption, and history of UTIs could further exacerbate kidney issues.

5. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While within ranges that are not immediately concerning for CKD, the overall metabolic profile, including high total cholesterol and triglycerides, suggests a potential for vascular disease, which can impact kidney health.

6. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of NSAIDs, despite being on statins, and the presence of muscle cramps and itching, could indicate complications or worsening kidney function.

7. **Health Behaviors**: Although the patient has a good health literacy score and attends regular medical checkups, the medication adherence score is relatively low, which could impact the effectiveness of treatments for conditions like diabetes and hypertension, further influencing CKD risk.

Given these factors, the risk of chronic kidney disease is considered high, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially more aggressive management of diabetes, blood pressure, and other contributing factors.",87,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 88/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, other intrinsic factors contribute to the risk.
2. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated levels (199.96 mg/dL and 8.79%, respectively) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP is slightly elevated at 143 mmHg, which can increase the risk of CKD progression.
4. **Kidney Function**: The GFR (87.40 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, but the creatinine level (3.33 mg/dL) is slightly elevated. The presence of protein in the urine (1.89 g/day) and an elevated ACR (235.49 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (33.33), moderate alcohol consumption (12.90 units/week), and relatively low diet quality (3.55/10) and sleep quality (4.56/10) contribute to the risk.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may be beneficial, but NSAID use (7.28 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function. Exposure to heavy metals is also a risk factor.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching may be related to CKD, and a relatively low QoL score (64.97/100) suggests an impact on daily life.

These factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adherence to medications are essential to manage and potentially reduce this risk.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 78/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 3.334730355153693 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as it is above the normal range.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 143 mmHg is above the ideal range, and uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.8912500188265888 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and an Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 235.49451959964975 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
4. **Family and Medical History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of previous conditions and current health status, such as high fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, indicate a risk for developing kidney issues.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI, moderate to high alcohol consumption, and a diet quality score of 3.553361493551519/10 may contribute to the risk of CKD.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time, and exposure to heavy metals is known to be nephrotoxic.
7. **Electrolyte and Cholesterol Levels**: While some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, high triglycerides and LDL cholesterol may contribute to cardiovascular risk factors that are also relevant to CKD.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of your medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk score:

1. **Family History**: The absence of family kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the genetic component of the risk.
2. **Lifestyle Factors**: 
   - **BMI**: A BMI of 33.33 indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the increased pressure on the kidneys and the potential for developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
   - **Alcohol Consumption**: Moderate alcohol consumption (12.9 units/week) may have varying effects on kidney health but is generally not considered high risk in this context.
   - **Physical Activity**: 7.99 hours/week of physical activity is beneficial for overall health, including kidney health, by helping to manage blood pressure and reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes.
   - **Diet Quality and Sleep Quality**: A diet quality score of 3.55/10 and a sleep quality score of 4.56/10 indicate areas for improvement, as poor diet and sleep can negatively affect kidney function and overall health.
3. **Medical History and Current Conditions**:
   - **Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 143 mmHg is elevated and increases the risk of CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (199.96 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.79%) indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
   - **Kidney Function Tests**: A creatinine level of 3.33 mg/dL and a GFR of 87.40 mL/min/1.73 m² suggest some degree of kidney impairment. The protein in urine (1.89 g/day) and ACR (235.49 mg/g) are also elevated, indicating kidney damage.
4. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics can be protective of kidney function, especially in the context of hypertension and proteinuria.
   - Exposure to heavy metals is a risk factor for CKD, as these can be nephrotoxic.

2. **Diabetes** – Fasting glucose 200 mg/dL and HbA1c 8.8% confirm uncontrolled diabetes, which accelerates nephropathy.  
3. **Hypertension** – Systolic 143 mmHg, though diastolic is low, still indicates systolic‑dominant hypertension; ACE‑inhibitor therapy suggests prior BP/renal concerns.  
4. **Lifestyle & exposures** – Obesity (BMI 33.3), frequent NSAID use (~7 ×/week), and reported heavy‑metal exposure further stress the kidneys.

- **Renal function markers** – Creatinine 4.27 mg/dL and eGFR 58.8 mL/min/1.73 m² already indicate stage 3b CKD.  
- **Proteinuria / ACR** – 0.55 g/day protein and 74 mg/g albumin‑creatinine ratio are well above normal, signaling ongoing glomerular injury.  
- **Blood pressure** – 163/108 mmHg is markedly hypertensive; uncontrolled hypertension is a major driver of CKD progression.  
- **Metabolic factors** – HbA1c 7.8 % and fasting glucose ~97 mg/dL reflect pre‑diabetes, while dyslipidemia (total 284 mg/dL, LDL 165 mg/dL, triglycerides 244 mg/dL) adds vascular risk.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (163/108 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidney function over time.
3. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The patient's creatinine level (4.270626527848026 mg/dL) and GFR (58.84008362643342 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function. The GFR is below the normal range, indicating a reduced ability of the kidneys to filter waste.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.5516143801223578 g/day) with an elevated ACR (74.06107395934202 mg/g) is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Metabolic Factors**: Although the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are not within the diabetic range, the patient's BMI (27.48107268811937) is classified as overweight, which can contribute to the development of CKD.
6. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors**: The patient's lifestyle, including physical activity (8.760328715212651 hours/week) and diet quality (8.09581302271286/10), is generally good, but the alcohol consumption (10.11931126040006 units/week) and occasional use of NSAIDs (5.759549124358952 times/week) could potentially impact kidney health.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease and Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (163/108 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as it can damage kidney blood vessels.
3. **Kidney Function**: The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 58.84 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function. The creatinine level is also elevated at 4.27 mg/dL, further suggesting kidney dysfunction.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.5516 g/day) with an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 74.06 mg/g is indicative of kidney damage.
5. **Previous UTIs**: A history of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD, especially if infections recur or are severe.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality and sleep quality are relatively good, the high BMI (27.48) and alcohol consumption (10.12 units/week) may contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (5.76 times/week) without other protective medications like ACE inhibitors or statins may exacerbate kidney damage. Poor medication adherence and limited health literacy also contribute to a higher risk score.

These factors cumulatively contribute to an elevated risk of chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring and potentially lifestyle and therapeutic interventions to mitigate this risk.",82,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: **88/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:

* Elevated creatinine levels (4.727932029637783 mg/dL) and protein in urine (1.921535064966416 g/day), indicating impaired kidney function and potential kidney damage.
* High blood pressure (169/98 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD.
* Family history of kidney disease, which increases the likelihood of developing CKD.
* Elevated fasting glucose (165.73873210457407 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.826113460112094%), suggesting poor glucose control, which can contribute to CKD progression.
* Low diet quality (2.443817463418385/10) and physical inactivity (0.7188945460001339 hours/week), which can exacerbate CKD risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes.
* Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic and worsen kidney function.

However, the relatively high GFR (119.13100972850437 mL/min/1.73 m²) and good sleep quality (7.754787037727386/10) may partially mitigate the CKD risk.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: A systolic BP of 166 mmHg is significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels of 188.13158814558312 mg/dL and 9.140454894443549%, respectively, indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, both of which are risk factors for CKD.
4. **Reduced Kidney Function**: A GFR of 22.598634304283085 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates significantly impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 1.7588597777566233 g/day of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances and Anemia**: The presence of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., slightly elevated sodium and phosphorus levels) and anemia (indicated by a hemoglobin level of 10.22765479753587 g/dL) can be associated with CKD.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can affect kidney function, potentially worsening CKD, though the presence of statins may have protective cardiovascular effects.
8. **Symptoms**: Edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching are all symptoms that can be associated with CKD, further indicating its presence and impact on quality of life.

Brief Rationale
Category
Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
Baseline Kidney Function
eGFR ≈ 23 mL/min/1.73 m² (Stage 4), Cr ≈ 3.55 mg/dL
Severe reduction in filtration → very high risk of progression.
Proteinuria / Albuminuria
1.76 g/day protein, ACR ≈ 67 mg/g
Markedly increased risk of further kidney injury.
Blood Pressure
Systolic 166 mmHg
Uncontrolled hypertension is a major driver of CKD decline.
Metabolic Control
Fasting glucose 188 mg/dL, HbA1c 9.1 %
Poor glycemic control accelerates nephropathy.
Medication & Exposures
NSAID use ≈ 4.4 ×/wk, no ACE‑i
NSAIDs are nephrotoxic; lack of renoprotective therapy raises risk.
Family History
Positive for kidney disease and hypertension
Genetic predisposition elevates baseline susceptibility.
Lifestyle
Moderate physical activity, adequate diet, no smoking
Slightly mitigates risk but cannot offset major physiological derangements.
Other Labs
Mild hyperlipidemia (LDL 122 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL), hypertriglyceridemia
Cardiovascular comorbidity compounds CKD risk.
Given the combination of advanced CKD stage, significant proteinuria, uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes, NSAID exposure, and a strong familial predisposition, the patient is in the upper percentile for progression and adverse outcomes. Hence a 94/100 risk score reflects a very high probability of rapid decline and need for early nephrology intervention.",94.0,African American,Black

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (152/100 mmHg) are above the normal range, which can damage kidney function over time.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The patient's fasting glucose (135.10751550046535 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.11666908171313%) levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.4319337088698849 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) (154.7917788812955 mg/g) suggest kidney damage or disease.
5. **Low GFR**: Although the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) (80.82492558626836 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, it is on the lower end, indicating potential kidney function impairment.
6. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of NSAIDs (5.547689001497064 times/week) may further increase the risk of CKD, while the patient's low health literacy (0.1897217692540442/10) and moderate medication adherence (5.583314115771953/10) may hinder effective management of underlying conditions.

However, the patient's low BMI (17.682530259266812), absence of smoking, and moderate physical activity level (7.0989610887122385 hours/week) are positive factors that may help mitigate the risk of CKD.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 73/100**

* Low kidney function, as evidenced by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 80.82492558626836 mL/min/1.73 m², which is lower than the ideal range.
* History of NSAIDs use (5.547689001497064 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney damage.
* Poor health behaviors, including low health literacy (0.1897217692540442/10) and mediocre medication adherence (5.583314115771953/10), which may hinder effective management of underlying conditions.

The risk score is determined based on multiple factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and exposures. Key points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: This is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and Protein in Urine**: High levels of creatinine (3.55 mg/dL) and significant proteinuria (3.73 g/day) indicate impaired kidney function and potential kidney damage.
3. **GFR**: Although the GFR is within the normal range (98.88 mL/min/1.73 m²), the presence of other risk factors and abnormal lab results suggests kidney stress or early kidney disease.
4. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Elevated potassium levels (5.36 mEq/L) can indicate kidney issues, as the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance.
5. **High Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 123 mmHg, although not drastically high, combined with a family history of hypertension, increases the risk of developing CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (34.43) and relatively low physical activity (2.73 hours/week) contribute to the risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
7. **Medications and Symptoms**: The use of diuretics and antidiabetic medications, along with symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, suggest current kidney issues or kidney-related problems.
8. **Poor Water Quality and Low Socioeconomic Status**: These factors can contribute to a higher risk of exposures to harmful substances and reduced access to healthcare, potentially worsening kidney disease outcomes.

Considering these factors, the risk score of 74/100 indicates a significant risk of chronic kidney disease.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor, as it can predispose to developing hypertension, a major cause of CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (123/89 mmHg) are not Extremely high, they are on the higher end, which can still contribute to kidney strain over time.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.725062580801228 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not typically allow large amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
4. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 155.53628852167628 mg/g is significantly elevated, indicating kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: The slightly elevated potassium level (5.3572835267651 mEq/L) may indicate reduced kidney function, as the kidneys play a crucial role in potassium balance.
6. **Medications and Substances**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (5.167264374221485 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with prolonged use.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of nausea/vomiting (6.5235257260957935 times/week), muscle cramps (5.769889753024507 times/week), and itching (3.4603224321170423/10) could be indicative of electrolyte imbalances and uremia, suggesting impaired kidney function.
8. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (34.43331285205483) and relatively low physical activity (2.7259428637998537 hours/week) contribute to an increased risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are major risk factors for CKD.
9. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially expose individuals to harmful substances that may affect kidney health.

These factors cumulatively contribute to a high risk score for CKD, underscoring the need for close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly adjustments in medication and treatment strategies to mitigate risk and slow disease progression.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 73/100**

The calculated risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided medical history and current health status. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 139 mmHg and diastolic BP of 85 mmHg are elevated, which poses a risk for kidney damage over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Levels are slightly elevated (136.42 mg/dL and 6.06%, respectively), indicating pre-diabetic conditions, which can impact kidney health.
4. **Creatinine and GFR**: A creatinine level of 4.88 mg/dL and a GFR of 110.58 mL/min/1.73 m² suggest impaired kidney function, though the GFR is still within a relatively normal range.
5. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The presence of 1.28 g/day of protein in urine, with an ACR of 255.76 mg/g, indicates kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While mostly within normal ranges, the overall profile suggests a need for monitoring due to the potential impact of dyslipidemia on kidney health.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, itching, and a relatively low QoL score indicates potential CKD-related symptoms and impact on daily life.
8. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs and statins, without ACE inhibitors or diuretics, may influence kidney function, but there's no reported exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.
9. **Health Behaviors**: Regular medical checkups, moderate medication adherence, and health literacy levels suggest a managed approach to health but room for improvement in preventive care.

These factors collectively indicate a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly intervention to prevent progression. Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers and adherence to recommended treatments are crucial.",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

* **Family History of Kidney Disease**: A positive family history increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure is 176 mmHg, which is above the normal range, and can cause kidney damage over time.
* **Abnormal Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Fasting glucose is 142.28 mg/dL and HbA1c is 8.37%, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can increase the risk of CKD.
* **Protein in Urine**: Proteinuria is present, with 1.69 g/day, which is a sign of kidney damage.
* **Decreased GFR**: Although the GFR is currently 73.94 mL/min/1.73 m², which is within the normal range, the presence of other risk factors increases the likelihood of a decline in GFR over time.
* **Medications**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a relatively low frequency, can be nephrotoxic and contribute to CKD progression.
* **Lifestyle Factors**: While some lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and sleep quality, are within relatively normal ranges, the diet quality is poor (2.74/10), which can contribute to CKD risk.

However, it's worth noting that some factors, such as the absence of smoking, normal BMI, and good water quality, may help mitigate the risk to some extent. Overall, the combination of genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors contributes to a high risk score for CKD.",83,African American,Caucasian,Risk Score: 82/100,82.0,African American,Caucasian

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease significantly increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: A systolic blood pressure of 176 mmHg is significantly higher than the recommended levels, contributing to kidney strain and potential damage over time.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: With a fasting glucose of 142.28 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 8.37%, there is an indication of impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of 1.692 g/day of protein in urine and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 22.51 mg/g indicates kidney damage or disease, as healthy kidneys would filter waste while retaining proteins.
5. **Current Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics suggests management of hypertension and possibly CKD, but NSAIDs use could potentially exacerbate kidney issues. The relatively low adherence to medical checkups and lower health literacy might hinder optimal disease management.
6. **Kidney Function**: A GFR of 73.94 mL/min/1.73 m², while within a range that might not immediately indicate severe kidney disease, combined with other factors such as elevated creatinine and BUN levels, suggests some degree of kidney impairment.

The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided medical history and lifestyle information. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 145 mmHg is above the normal range, and although diastolic BP is within the normal range, the systolic value is a risk factor for CKD.
3. **High Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Creatinine of 2.6248 mg/dL and BUN of 35.061 mg/dL indicate impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR 168.04964716358813 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and low physical activity (6.51578927980252 hours/week) are known risk factors for CKD.
6. **Diet Quality and Obesity (BMI 39.05757457935692)**: Poor diet quality and obesity are associated with an increased risk of developing CKD.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can affect kidney function, though the presence of statins may have a protective effect on cardiovascular risk factors associated with CKD.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate this risk include:
- **Good Sleep Quality**: High sleep quality score (9.166245607157787/10) may help in managing stress and overall health.
- **No Family History of Kidney Disease, Hypertension, or Diabetes**: The absence of these familial risk factors slightly decreases the overall risk.
- **Good Water Quality and No Exposure to Heavy Metals**: These environmental factors can contribute to kidney damage if exposure occurs.

The calculated risk score reflects a heightened risk for CKD, necessitating close monitoring of kidney function, management of blood pressure, and lifestyle adjustments to mitigate known risk factors.",74,African American,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100

Reasoning
Age (76 y)
↑
Advanced age is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
BMI (39 kg/m²)
↑
Obesity contributes to glomerular hyperfiltration and later nephron loss.
Previous AKI episode
↑
History of acute kidney injury strongly predicts chronic kidney disease.
Proteinuria (0.56 g/day) & ACR (168 mg/g)
↑
Sub‑nephrotic range proteinuria and albumin‑creatinine ratio > 100 mg/g are indicators of ongoing kidney damage.
Blood pressure (145/68 mmHg)
↑
Systolic hypertension (≥ 140) is a driver of CKD progression.
Creatinine 2.62 mg/dL
↑
Elevated serum creatinine suggests reduced filtration capacity.
GFR 110 mL/min/1.73 m²
Neutral/contradictory
While the value appears normal, it conflicts with high creatinine; we assume a moderate‑to‑severe reduction given the other markers.
Smoking & NSAID use (≈ 1.7 ×/wk)
↑
Both increase the risk of kidney injury and worsen renal function.
Diuretic therapy
Neutral
May reflect hypertension or volume status; potential for electrolyte disturbance but not a direct CKD risk factor.
Statin use
Neutral
Helpful for cardiovascular risk but not protective against CKD.
Low medication adherence (0.18/10)
↑
Poor adherence can worsen blood‑pressure control and lipid profile, accelerating CKD.
Lifestyle (moderate physical activity, good sleep, moderate alcohol)
↓
These factors provide some protective effects, but the overall risk remains high.
Overall, the combination of advanced age, obesity, prior AKI, significant proteinuria, elevated blood pressure, high creatinine, smoking, NSAID use, and poor medication adherence places you at a high risk for chronic kidney disease progression, justifying a score of ~80 %.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

1. **Previous AKI**: A history of acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Impaired kidney function**: The calculated GFR is within the normal range, but the creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating some degree of kidney impairment.
3. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.558 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 168.05 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
4. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure is elevated at 145 mmHg, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
5. **Lifestyle factors**: A high BMI, smoking, and low physical activity level contribute to the increased risk.
6. **Laboratory results**: Elevated BUN and potassium levels, although within normal ranges, along with high triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, also contribute to the risk.
7. **Medication use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, may further increase the risk of CKD progression.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:
- The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
- Good sleep quality and relatively high health-related quality of life score.
- The patient's adherence to statin medication, which can help manage cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to CKD.

Overall, while there are several risk factors present, the absence of certain other risk factors and the presence of some protective factors result in a risk score that indicates a significant but not extreme risk of chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of the identified risk factors are crucial to prevent or slow the progression of CKD.",74,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and exposures. The key points that contribute to this risk score include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):** A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD. This is because AKI can lead to permanent damage and scarring in the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter waste and excess fluids.

2. **Family History:** While there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which are common risk factors for CKD, the absence of these does not significantly mitigate the risk given the presence of other risk factors.

3. **Systolic Blood Pressure:** Elevated systolic blood pressure (145 mmHg) is a risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time, reducing their function.

4. **Laboratory Results:**
   - **Creatinine and GFR:** A creatinine level of 2.6248102016269685 mg/dL and a GFR of 110.19534832886345 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate that while the GFR is within a normal range, the creatinine level is somewhat elevated. However, GFR can remain within the normal range until significant kidney damage has occurred.
   - **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria):** The presence of protein in the urine (0.558254033404727 g/day) with an ACR of 168.04964716358813 mg/g suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
   - **Electrolytes and Other Metrics:** The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are generally within normal ranges, but slight deviations, especially the elevated potassium level (5.0195413950423555 mEq/L), can indicate kidney issues as the kidneys help regulate electrolyte balance.

5. **Medications:** The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can affect kidney function. Diuretics, while used to manage conditions like hypertension and fluid retention, can strain the kidneys over time. NSAIDs are known to reduce blood flow to the kidneys and can cause kidney damage with long-term use.

6. **Lifestyle Factors:**
   - **",74,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score:** 75/100

**Brief Rationale**

1. **Renal Function & Albuminuria** – Creatinine is markedly elevated (≈2.6 mg/dL) and the ACR is 168 mg/g, well above the KDIGO threshold of 30 mg/g, indicating significant kidney damage despite an eGFR that appears preserved (likely due to a calculation artefact).  
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury** – A prior AKI episode is a strong predictor of progression to chronic kidney disease.  
3. **Lifestyle & Comorbidities** –  
   • BMI ≈ 39 kg/m² (class III obesity).  
   • Current smoking and moderate alcohol intake.  
   • Elevated triglycerides (≈348 mg/dL) and LDL (≈111 mg/dL) suggest atherogenic risk that can further impair renal perfusion.  
4. **Blood Pressure** – Systolic BP of 145 mmHg is elevated; diastolic is low but the systolic value contributes to CK",75.0,African American,Hispanic

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, and current health status. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Age and Gender**: As a 66-year-old female, age is a significant risk factor for CKD, with the risk increasing substantially after the age of 60. Gender also plays a role, with women generally having a lower risk than men, but this advantage decreases with age.

2. **Socioeconomic Status and Education**: A low socioeconomic status can limit access to healthcare resources and healthy lifestyle choices, potentially increasing the risk of CKD. Having a Bachelor's degree may offer some protective effects due to better health literacy and access to information.

3. **Lifestyle Factors**:
   - **Alcohol Consumption**: While the reported alcohol consumption is within a moderate range, excessive or binge drinking could negatively impact kidney health.
   - **Physical Activity**: The reported level of physical activity is relatively high, which can be protective against CKD.
   - **Diet Quality and Sleep Quality**: Good diet quality and excellent sleep quality are beneficial for overall health and can mitigate some risks associated with CKD.

4. **Medical History**:
   - The absence of family histories of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the genetic predisposition risk.
   - No previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) or UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) is beneficial, as these conditions can increase the risk of developing CKD.

5. **Current Health Status**:
   - **Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are within a relatively normal range, which is beneficial.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level is slightly elevated, and the HbA1c is near the upper limit of normal, indicating a potential risk for diabetes, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
   - **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level is elevated, and the GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is slightly below the normal range, indicating some level of kidney impairment. The BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) level is within a relatively normal range.
   - **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are largely within normal ranges",73,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on the provided clinical, lifestyle, and exposure data. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 4.066 mg/dL and a GFR of 66.416 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.173 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 251.505 mg/g suggest kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.

3. **Family History and Hypertension**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease or hypertension, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are within a relatively normal range but on the higher end, which can still impact kidney health over time.

4. **Lifestyle Factors**: The moderate alcohol consumption (18.642 units/week) and relatively low diet quality (0.7478/10) may negatively affect kidney health. However, the absence of smoking, a BMI within the normal range (23.018), and regular physical activity (7.019 hours/week) are positive factors.

5. **Medical History and Medications**: The absence of previous AKI, UTIs, and the use of certain medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics which can affect kidney function, influence the risk score. The occasional use of NSAIDs (4.675 times/week) could potentially strain kidney function.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a compromised quality of life score (54.189), may reflect the impact of kidney disease on overall health.

7. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Exposure to heavy metals and good water quality, along with regular medical checkups (1.259 times/year), good medication adherence (8.280/10), and high health literacy (8.845/10), play a role in the risk assessment.

**Rationale – main points**

1. **Advanced CKD stage** – GFR 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m² places her in CKD stage 4, a high‑risk category for progression to end‑stage renal disease.  
2. **Marked proteinuria/albuminuria** – 3.3 g/day protein and ACR 116 mg/g are well above the KDIGO threshold for high‑risk albuminuria, indicating significant glomerular injury.  
3. **Poor glycaemic control** – Fasting glucose 143 mg/dL and HbA1c 8.86 % reflect uncontrolled diabetes, the leading cause of CKD progression.  
4. **Hypertensive diastolic pressure** – Diastolic BP 95 mmHg (with a normal systolic) suggests isolated diastolic hypertension, which still contributes to renal damage.  
5. **Anemia & poor nutritional markers** – Hb 10.8 g/dL and relatively low calcium hint at chronic disease burden, which can accelerate kidney decline.  
6. **Lifestyle factors** – Although BMI is normal and physical activity is reasonable, frequent NSAID use (~8 ×/week) can exacerbate renal injury.  
7. **Limited protective measures** – Despite ACE inhibitor therapy, the combination of uncontrolled diabetes, albuminuria, and diast",85.0,Caucasian,Caucasian

The provided data indicates a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to several factors:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor for CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level of 142.63445056268893 mg/dL and HbA1c of 8.864450223575133% suggest poorly managed diabetes or prediabetes, both of which can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Decreased GFR**: A GFR of 17.93976299616582 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, as normal GFR is typically considered to be above 90 mL/min/1.73 m².
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.3141203376009982 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **High Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic BP is at the higher end of the normal range, the diastolic BP of 95 mmHg is elevated, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for CKD.
6. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for kidney protection, but the occasional use of NSAIDs (8.043039376387323 times/week) could potentially worsen kidney function due to their nephrotoxic effects.
7. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality could potentially expose the individual to harmful substances that might further stress kidney function.

Despite some positive factors such as a high diet quality, good physical activity level, and adherence to medication, the cumulative effect of the risk factors mentioned above places the individual at a high risk for chronic kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors. Main points include: 
1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (163 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **High HbA1c Levels**: Despite the absence of a family history of diabetes, the patient's HbA1c level (9.4867%) is high, indicating poor glucose control, which can be detrimental to kidney health.
4. **Low GFR**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 43.125 mL/min/1.73 m², which is lower than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (3.288 g/day) and a high Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 179.1609 mg/g suggests kidney damage.
6. **Poor Diet Quality and Low Physical Activity**: The patient's diet quality is poor (0.347/10), and physical activity level is low (1.602 hours/week), contributing to an increased risk of CKD.
7. **Limited Health Literacy and Infrequent Medical Checkups**: Low health literacy (1.072/10) and fewer medical checkups (1.550/year) may lead to inadequate management of risk factors and monitoring of kidney health.
8. **Use of Diuretics and NSAIDs**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, even at low frequency, can have adverse effects on kidney function, especially in the context of existing kidney issues.
9. **Poor Water Quality**: Exposure to poor water quality may pose additional health risks, including potential kidney damage from contaminants.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **High Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure is 163 mmHg, which is significantly higher than the normal range. High blood pressure is a leading cause of CKD.
3. **Low GFR**: The patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 43.125 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function. A low GFR is a key indicator of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 3.288 g/day of protein in the urine suggests kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Poor Diet Quality and Physical Inactivity**: A diet quality score of 0.347/10 and physical activity of only 1.602 hours/week contribute to an increased risk of CKD, as poor diet and lack of exercise can exacerbate factors like hypertension and diabetes.
6. **High HbA1c**: An HbA1c level of 9.486% indicates poor glucose control, which can increase the risk of developing kidney disease, even though there is no reported family history of diabetes.
7. **Use of Diuretics and NSAIDs**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can potentially worsen kidney function, especially with long-term use.

While some factors like the absence of smoking and the lack of exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals are positive, the cumulative effect of the aforementioned risk factors places this patient at a high risk for chronic kidney disease.",87,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

* Family history of hypertension, which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Previous acute kidney injury (AKI), which is a known risk factor for CKD
* Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, indicating impaired glucose regulation and potential diabetic nephropathy
* High blood pressure (systolic BP 116 mmHg and diastolic BP 101 mmHg) which can damage kidneys over time
* Elevated creatinine and BUN levels, indicating impaired kidney function
* High proteinuria (4. g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR  mg/g), which are markers of kidney damage
* Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney damage
* Poor medication adherence and low health literacy, which can hinder effective management of CKD risk factors.

* **Family history of hypertension**: Increases the risk of developing CKD.
* **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: Indicates a higher risk of progressing to CKD.
* **Elevated blood pressure (116/101 mmHg)**: Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
* **High fasting glucose (174.26425503862788 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.66111928285497%)**: Indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* **Elevated creatinine (1.7582997634459026 mg/dL) and BUN (44.982182145065224 mg/dL)**: Suggest impaired kidney function.
* **High protein in urine (4.845703300806401 g/day) and ACR (156.57357908304982 mg/g)**: Indicate kidney damage.

Summary
The combination of substantial albuminuria, impaired glucose control, a history of AKI, elevated blood pressure, and frequent NSAID use places this individual at a high probability of progressive chronic kidney disease. Although the calculated eGFR is within normal limits (likely due to an inaccurate measurement or an unusual calculation), the other markers (creatinine 1.76 mg/dL, high protein excretion) suggest early renal injury.

The risk score of 74/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided information:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk for developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of AKI is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD. Previous damage to the kidneys can lead to long-term kidney dysfunction.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 116 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 101 mmHg are on the higher end of normal, and uncontrolled hypertension is a significant risk factor for CKD.
4. **Abnormal Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level of 174.26 mg/dL and HbA1c of 6.66% indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD, even if not meeting the full criteria for diabetes.
5. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level of 1.76 mg/dL and BUN level of 44.98 mg/dL suggest some level of kidney impairment, as these waste products are normally filtered out by the kidneys.
6. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.85 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 156.57 mg/g are significant indicators of kidney damage.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs can impact kidney function, with NSAIDs potentially worsening kidney function, especially with frequent use.
8. **Suboptimal Lifestyle Factors**: Low physical activity (0.62 hours/week) and moderate alcohol consumption (0.45 units/week), along with a relatively low diet quality score (6.73/10), contribute to the risk.

However, factors that mitigate the risk to some extent include:
- Good water quality.
- No exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.
- The absence of smoking.

Given these factors, a comprehensive approach to managing CKD risk would include blood pressure control, tight glucose monitoring, dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and careful management of medications that could affect kidney function.

Rationale
Proteinuria & ACR – 4.85 g/day protein and an ACR of 156 mg/g are well above the CKD thresholds, indicating significant glomerular injury.
Prior AKI and hypertension – A history of acute kidney injury and elevated diastolic pressure (101 mmHg) heighten progression risk.
Glycemic status – Fasting glucose 174 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.66 % point to impaired glucose control, a strong driver of CKD progression.
Medication & exposure – Frequent NSAID use (~4 × week) and diuretic therapy can aggravate renal perfusion and worsen proteinuria.
Lipid profile & blood pressure – High LDL (186 mg/dL) and triglycerides (292 mg/dL) add vascular stress to kidneys.
Lifestyle factors – Low BMI (~17) and modest physical activity may reflect poor overall health status, potentially compounding renal risk.
Overall – While the current GFR is within normal limits, the combination of high proteinuria, ACR, and comorbidities suggests a moderate‑high probability of CKD progression, thus a score of 78/100.",78.0,African American,Hispanic

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several key factors:

1. **Low GFR (33.70130387563574 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: Indicates reduced kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
2. **Elevated Creatinine (4.883683709432651 mg/dL)** and **BUN Level (42.98803288270081 mg/dL)**: These are markers of kidney function, and high levels suggest impaired kidney function.
3. **Family History of Hypertension**: Although not directly a kidney issue, hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD, and a family history may indicate a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure.
4. **Presence of Protein in Urine (0.593355770962043 g/day)** and **ACR (70.2306751399159 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a key indicator of kidney damage, a hallmark of CKD.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: The levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are within or near the upper limits of their respective ranges, which could indicate kidney issues in regulating these electrolytes.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate this risk include:
- **No Previous AKI or UTIs**: Absence of these conditions reduces the risk of CKD.
- **Good Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: High diet quality and regular physical activity can help manage risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes.
- **No Exposure to Heavy Metals or Occupational Chemicals**: Avoidance of these exposures reduces the risk of kidney damage.

Overall, while there are significant indicators of kidney dysfunction, lifestyle factors and the absence of certain risk exposures somewhat temper the risk score.

- **Family history of hypertension**: Increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- **Elevated creatinine and BUN levels**: Indicative of impaired kidney function.
- **Low GFR (33.70130387563574 mL/min/1.73 m²)**: Indicates reduced kidney function, a key marker for CKD.
- **Presence of protein in urine (0.593355770962043 g/day) and elevated ACR (70.2306751399159 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
- **Electrolyte imbalances and abnormal hemoglobin levels**: May reflect underlying issues related to kidney function and overall health.
- **Lifestyle factors**: While the diet quality is good, and physical activity is relatively high, the presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching may indicate current kidney issues or other health problems.
- **Medications and health behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a low frequency, can be harmful to kidney function over time. Good health literacy and adherence to medication are positive factors but may not fully counteract the risks associated with other factors.

The rationale for this risk score is based on the provided medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. Main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as hypertension is a major cause of kidney damage.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The elevated creatinine (4.88 mg/dL) and BUN (42.99 mg/dL) levels indicate impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
3. **Low GFR**: A GFR of 33.70 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly below the normal range, indicating reduced kidney function and suggesting stage 3 CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.59 g/day) and an elevated ACR (70.23 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
5. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is elevated (110 mmHg), which could be indicative of hypertension and a risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: While the diet quality is good, and physical activity is adequate, the alcohol consumption is relatively high, which could have negative effects on kidney health.
7. **Medications and Exposures**: The lack of protective medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors) for kidney health, combined with occasional NSAID use, which can be harmful to kidneys, also contributes to the risk score.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include good diet quality, regular physical activity, and a high level of health literacy and medication adherence, which can help in managing and slowing CKD progression.

2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level of 4.883683709432651 mg/dL and BUN level of 42.98803288270081 mg/dL are indicative of impaired kidney function, suggesting existing kidney damage or disease.
3. **Low GFR**: A GFR of 33.70130387563574 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates reduced kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine (ACR 70.2306751399159 mg/g)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage, further increasing the risk of CKD progression.
5. **Hypertension Indicators**: Although the diastolic BP is slightly elevated at 110 mmHg, which could be a concern, the systolic BP is relatively low at 96 mmHg. However, the overall BP management and its impact on kidney health need careful consideration.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high diet quality and regular physical activity are positive factors, but the alcohol consumption and use of NSAIDs could potentially negatively affect kidney health.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and itching, along with a significant frequency of nausea/vomiting, suggests a considerable impact on quality of life and may indicate more severe kidney issues.

The combination of these factors, especially the direct indicators of kidney function and damage (elevated creatinine, low GFR, and protein in urine), significantly contributes to the high risk score for CKD.

CKD prevalence rises steeply after 70 yrs; age is a strong non‑modifiable risk factor.
Proteinuria 1.9 g/day & ACR 224 mg/g
+30 %
Persistent protein excretion above 300 mg/day and an ACR >200 mg/g are hallmarks of glomerular injury and predict rapid eGFR decline.
GFR 115 mL/min/1.73 m²

While the GFR itself is above the CKD threshold (>60), the coexistence of significant proteinuria indicates early‑stage damage that may progress.
NSAID use ≈3 ×/week
+10 %
Repeated NSAID exposure can trigger interstitial nephritis and worsen pre‑existing glomerular disease.
Low medication adherence (2.6/10)
+10 %
Poor adherence to prescribed nephroprotective agents (e.g., statin, possible ACEI) can accelerate kidney injury.
Low health literacy (0.15/10)

The calculated risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided clinical and lifestyle data. The main points contributing to this risk assessment include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor for CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Level**: Although the HbA1c level of 4.301% is within the normal range, indicating good glucose control, the family history of diabetes still poses a risk.
3. **Creatinine Level**: The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 2.0643197417104036 mg/dL, which may indicate some level of kidney impairment. However, this value alone does not signify severe kidney disease but warrants monitoring.
4. **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**: A GFR of 115.23618134926907 mL/min/1.73 m² is actually higher than the normal range (which typically is considered to be between 90-120 mL/min/1.73 m² for adults), suggesting good kidney function at this time.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 1.905935925861307 g/day of protein in the urine is a risk factor for CKD, as it indicates kidney damage.
6. **Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 224.13222257506513 mg/g is significantly elevated, indicating substantial proteinuria, which is a strong predictor of kidney disease progression.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's smoking habit and relatively low physical activity level (8.857475337188323 hours/week) are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which can indirectly affect kidney health.
8. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, but the frequency of NSAID use (2.98913898225311 times/week) could potentially be harmful to kidney function if not monitored closely.
9. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a lower quality of life score, may indicate some level of kidney dysfunction affecting overall health.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on various factors, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The key points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Family history of diabetes**: This is a significant risk factor for CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Higher BMI (28.56)**: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing CKD.
3. **Smoking and alcohol consumption**: Both of these habits can damage kidneys over time and increase CKD risk.
4. **Elevated creatinine (2.06 mg/dL) and BUN (18.96 mg/dL) levels**: These indicate impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in urine (1.90 g/day) and high ACR (224.13 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a hallmark of kidney damage and a strong predictor of CKD progression.
6. **Suboptimal health behaviors**: Low medication adherence (2.61/10), poor health literacy (0.15/10), and fewer medical checkups (0.99/year) may hinder proper management of risk factors and CKD progression.
7. **Laboratory values within normal or near-normal ranges for electrolytes, cholesterol, and hemoglobin** suggest that, despite CKD risk factors, there are no severe imbalances that would further elevate the risk score.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **No family history of kidney disease or hypertension**.
- **Normal or near-normal systolic and diastolic blood pressure**.
- **Good diet quality (7.95/10) and physical activity level (8.86 hours/week)**.
- **Use of statins**, which can help manage cholesterol levels and potentially have protective effects on the kidneys.

Overall, while there are significant risk factors present, the absence of severe hypertension, kidney disease family history, and the presence of some positive health behaviors and medication use contribute to a score that, while concerning, does not reach the highest levels of risk.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 72/100

The risk score is based on several factors that contribute to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key points include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor, as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **High BMI and Diet Quality**: A BMI of 28.56 indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for developing CKD. Although the diet quality score is relatively high (7.95/10), the overall lifestyle factors, including being overweight and smoking, contribute to the risk.
3. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and alcohol consumption (13.68 units/week) are both harmful to kidney health and increase the risk of CKD.
4. **Laboratory Values**: The fasting glucose and HbA1c levels are within normal ranges, which is positive. However, the creatinine level is slightly elevated (2.064 mg/dL), and the GFR, although within the normal range (115.24 mL/min/1.73 m²), combined with the protein in urine (1.905 g/day) and ACR (224.13 mg/g), indicates some level of kidney stress or early damage.
5. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: The electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, but the high total cholesterol (231.73 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (119.30 mg/dL) levels, combined with low HDL cholesterol (34.24 mg/dL), contribute to cardiovascular risk, which is also a risk factor for CKD progression.
6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, but the lack of adherence to medication (2.614/10) and low health literacy (0.145/10) are concerning. Frequent NSAID use (2.989 times/week) can also be harmful to kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score (49.64/100), suggests that there may already be some impact on health and well-being that could be related to kidney function or other underlying health issues.

The high risk score is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Kidney Function**: Your GFR (Glucose Filtration Rate) is 35.486332831190296 mL/min/1.73 m², which indicates a significant reduction in kidney function. A normal GFR is approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher. Your reduced GFR places you in stage 3b of chronic kidney disease (CKD), according to the National Kidney Foundation's staging.

2. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: You have a significant amount of protein in your urine (1.976234804733258 g/day), which is an indicator of kidney damage. The Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) is also elevated at 251.03112908277976 mg/g, further supporting the presence of kidney damage.

3. **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)**: Your HbA1c level is 8.524619487704538%, indicating poor blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time.

4. **Blood Pressure**: Although your current blood pressure (119/67 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of kidney disease increases the risk of developing hypertension, which can further damage kidney function.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While you have some positive lifestyle habits (e.g., moderate physical activity), your smoking habit and relatively high BMI (32.273784156698895) pose additional risks for kidney disease progression. Smoking can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and worsen kidney function, and excess weight can increase the risk of developing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, which are major risk factors for CKD.

6. **Electrolytes and Cholesterol**: Your levels of potassium (5.172372416630423 mEq/L), phosphorus (3.700711101566332 mg/dL), and certain cholesterol metrics are at or near the upper limits of their respective ranges, which can be indicative of or contribute to kidney disease progression.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors including demographic information, medical history, current health status, lifestyle, and exposures. Key points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Pre-existing Conditions**: A history of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) increases the risk of CKD.
2. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the presence of AKI and UTIs indicates a predisposition to kidney issues.
3. **Blood Pressure**: While systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could indicate potential vascular issues affecting kidney function.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD, even though HbA1c is not severely elevated.
5. **Renal Function Tests**: The patient has a reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 56.20730395965481 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in urine (proteinuria) with an Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 141.38725531025713 mg/g further supports kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Hemoglobin**: The elevated potassium level could be indicative of decreased kidney function, as the kidneys are responsible for potassium excretion. Hemoglobin levels are within a relatively normal range but on the lower end.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the patient does not smoke, alcohol consumption is moderate. Physical activity and diet quality are relatively good, which are positive factors.
8. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors suggests management of hypertension or proteinuria, which is beneficial for slowing CKD progression.

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on various factors from the provided information. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: Recurrent UTIs can lead to kidney damage over time.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic BP is slightly elevated, which can still pose a risk.
4. **Fasting Glucose**: The high fasting glucose level indicates impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
5. **HbA1c**: The HbA1c level, although not diabetic, suggests some degree of impaired glucose control.
6. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is a marker of kidney damage.
7. **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**: A GFR of 56 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function.
8. ** Electrolyte Imbalances**: The elevated potassium level can be a sign of kidney dysfunction.
9. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for patients with kidney issues, indicates that there might be a pre-existing kidney condition being managed.
10. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching can be indicative of uremia, a condition associated with advanced kidney disease.

However, factors that somewhat mitigate this risk include a relatively healthy BMI, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, and a diet quality that, while not perfect, is above average. Despite these positive lifestyle factors, the presence of significant kidney function indicators (e.g., proteinuria, reduced GFR, previous AKI) and metabolic risks (e.g., impaired glucose regulation) contribute to an elevated risk score for CKD. Regular monitoring and adherence to treatment plans are crucial to manage and potentially slow the progression of kidney disease.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100

* Previous history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), which increase the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
* Abnormal kidney function indicators, including a reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 56.21 mL/min/1.73 m² and elevated protein in urine (4.14 g/day) and Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 141.39 mg/g, all of which are signs of kidney damage.
* Use of ACE inhibitors, which, while beneficial for blood pressure control, can also indicate the presence of conditions like hypertension or heart failure that increase CKD risk.
* Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which could be indicative of uremic symptoms related to reduced kidney function.
* Elevated levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol, which are cardiovascular risk factors that can also impact kidney health.
* Lower than ideal health literacy and medication adherence scores, which could impact the effectiveness of managing conditions that contribute to CKD risk.

However, the score is not higher due to factors such as:
- The absence of family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.
- Good water quality and no exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals.
- A BMI within the normal range and regular physical activity, which are protective factors.
- No use of diuretics or antidiabetic medications, which could indicate less severe disease management needs.

The provided data indicates a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this assessment include:

1. **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: A history of previous AKI is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD, as it can lead to irreversible damage and reduce kidney function over time.

2. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: The creatinine level of 1.917 mg/dL and a GFR of 35.862 mL/min/1.73 m² are indicative of impaired kidney function. A lower GFR is a direct marker of kidney disease, as it measures how well the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood.

3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 1.888970924551194 g/day of protein in the urine (proteinuria) is abnormal and a key indicator of kidney damage. The ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) of 14.613418703262504 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage.

4. **Hypertension**: The systolic BP of 158 mmHg is higher than the normal range, indicating hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time, reducing their ability to function properly.

5. **Diabetes Management**: Although the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest controlled diabetes (with the help of antidiabetic medications), diabetes is a leading cause of CKD. The fact that antidiabetic medications are being used implies that diabetes is being managed but is still a risk factor.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The high BMI of 31.0048467134258 indicates obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of developing CKD. The relatively low diet quality score (0.2768988675877537/10) may also contribute to the risk of CKD, as a healthy diet is crucial for maintaining good kidney health.

7. **Medications and Substances**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs (4.4046053293873815 times/week) can affect kidney function. NSAIDs, in particular, are known to potentially reduce kidney function when used regularly over long periods.

3. **Low GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 16.555 mL/min/1.73 m² is significantly lower than the normal range, indicating reduced kidney function. This is a direct indicator of CKD.

4. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The presence of protein in the urine (ACR of 142.200804 mg/g) is a sign of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large molecules like proteins to pass into the urine.

5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Elevated potassium levels (5.268713619521401 mEq/L) and other electrolyte disturbances can be both a cause and a consequence of kidney dysfunction.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD. The high BMI (26.72047395038103) and poor diet quality (6.040179965751782/10) also contribute to the risk.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (7.0525293401251785 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and the relatively low adherence to medication, health literacy, and frequency of medical checkups may hinder proper management of CKD risk factors.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.922285471860696 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, as normal ranges are typically between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/dL for adult males.
2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 4.774301465095484 g/day of protein in urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage.
3. **High Blood Pressure**: With a systolic blood pressure of 163 mmHg and diastolic of 97 mmHg, you are at increased risk, as hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Impaired Glucose Regulation**: An HbA1c of 9.282186457147436% suggests poorly controlled blood sugar, which is a significant risk factor for developing kidney disease.
5. **Family History and Other Factors**: Although there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the combination of high blood pressure, impaired glucose regulation, and signs of kidney damage (elevated creatinine and proteinuria) signifies a high risk.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While your dietary quality and physical activity levels are good, the high BMI, alcohol consumption of 8.648947192104275 units/week, and lower adherence to medication and health literacy scores could contribute to the risk.

Given these factors, it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage blood pressure, glucose levels, and to address the existing kidney damage indicators.

The calculated risk score of 87/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided comprehensive medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this high risk assessment include:

1. **Family History**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, which could have increased the risk, the absence of these does not significantly lower the risk given the presence of other factors.

2. **Clinical Measures**:
   - **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (163/97 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
   - **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: High levels (170.59410377754247 mg/dL and 9.282186457147436%, respectively) indicate poor glucose control, suggesting diabetes or prediabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
   - **Kidney Function**: Elevated creatinine (4.922285471860696 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (65.58312838930983 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
   - **Proteinuria**: High levels of protein in urine (4.774301465095484 g/day) and an elevated ACR (124.06501966361392 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage.

3. **Lifestyle and Behavior**:
   - **Physical Activity and Diet Quality**: While the physical activity level is high (8.962270573081083 hours/week) and diet quality is good (9.789418121813776/10), these positive factors are outweighed by other risk factors.
   - **Sleep Quality**: Poor sleep quality (5.302987095738653/10) can exacerbate health conditions, including CKD.

4. **Medications and Exposures**:
   - **NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (1.6508756220266207 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.
   - **No Protective Medications**: Not being on ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or statins, which can help manage conditions related to CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic/diastolic BP of 163/97 mmHg is above the normal range, indicating hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
2. **Abnormal Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: With a fasting glucose of 170.59 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 9.28%, there is clear evidence of hyperglycemia, suggesting diabetes mellitus or prediabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 65.58 mL/min/1.73 m², although not severely impaired, is on the lower end of the normal range, indicating some level of kidney function impairment.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 4.77 g/day of protein in the urine is a significant indicator of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.
5. **High Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Elevated creatinine (4.92 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (37.26 mg/dL) further support the presence of kidney dysfunction.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The slightly elevated potassium level (5.08 mEq/L) can be associated with kidney dysfunction, as kidneys play a crucial role in potassium regulation.
7. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: While the diet quality is good (9.79/10) and physical activity is high (8.96 hours/week), the presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and a moderate level of NSAID use could contribute to or be consequences of CKD, and the relatively low health literacy (4.22/10) and medication adherence (5.62/10) might hinder optimal management of the condition.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease, underscoring the need for close medical monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage blood pressure, blood glucose, and to protect kidney function.",87,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 92/100**

8. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: While the BMI and physical activity level are within healthy ranges, the diet quality is relatively low, and there is a history of alcohol consumption, which can all impact kidney health.

However, the calculated GFR (96.01778359491205 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, which might seem contradictory to the high risk assessment. It's crucial to note that GFR can remain within the normal range until significant kidney damage has occurred, and other factors such as proteinuria and history of AKI are strong indicators of kidney disease risk.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History of Diabetes**: Having a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing CKD, as diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: A history of AKI is a significant risk factor for the development and progression of CKD.
3. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values are higher than ideal, which can damage kidneys over time and accelerate CKD progression.
4. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) are strong indicators of kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
5. **Increased Creatinine and BUN Levels**: Elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest impaired kidney function.
6. **Hemoglobin and Electrolyte Levels**: Although within or near normal ranges, the combination of these factors alongside others contributes to the overall risk assessment.
7. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics may indicate management of hypertension and fluid balance, common in CKD, but also NSAIDs use could potentially worsen kidney function.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a decreased quality of life score, can be associated with CKD and its progression.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for CKD, emphasizing the need for close monitoring, strict control of blood pressure, management of proteinuria, and possibly adjusting medications and lifestyle interventions to slow disease progression.",87,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 83/100
The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score are:
Family history of diabetes: Increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Previous AKI: Indicates a higher risk of CKD progression
Elevated creatinine and BUN levels: Suggests impaired kidney function
Protein in urine (4.9 g/day) and high ACR (298.2 mg/g): Indicates significant kidney damage
Hypertension (BP 139/111 mmHg): Increases the risk of CKD progression
Medication use (ACE inhibitors and diuretics): May be indicative of existing kidney disease or cardiovascular comorbidities
Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching: May be related to kidney disease or other comorbidities
Suboptimal health behaviors (e.g., low medical checkups/year, moderate medication adherence, and health literacy): May contribute to poor disease management and increased risk of CKD progression
However, some factors such as high socioeconomic status, good water quality, and no heavy metals or occupational chemical exposure may have a mitigating effect on the risk score. Additionally, good diet quality and regular physical activity may help slow CKD progression. Nevertheless, the overall risk score remains high due to the presence of multiple risk factors and existing kidney damage.

- **Proteinuria**: The presence of a substantial amount of protein in the urine (4.38 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 264.86 mg/g suggest kidney damage.
- **Hypertension**: A blood pressure of 134/104 mmHg indicates hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
- **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family history increases the risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption can exacerbate kidney damage.
- **Medications and Conditions**: The use of ACE inhibitors, while beneficial for controlling hypertension and proteinuria, also indicates the presence of conditions that require such medication, contributing to the risk assessment.
- **Electrolyte and Lipid Profile**: Abnormal levels, such as elevated potassium and triglycerides, can be associated with kidney dysfunction and contribute to the risk.

The provided data indicates a high risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for developing CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (134/104 mmHg) are higher than the ideal range, indicating hypertension, which can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (121.76734012243324 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.271340934282413%) are on the higher side, suggesting impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 29.148210683634055 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates significantly impaired kidney function, as it is below the normal range (which typically is considered to be above 90 mL/min/1.73 m² for adults).
5. **Proteinuria**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.375789740458838 g/day) and an elevated ACR (264.8589991783336 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: While most electrolytes are within range, the slightly elevated potassium (5.104447864014288 mEq/L) could indicate renal issues, as the kidneys play a key role in potassium balance.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: High BMI (35.39638139364226), smoking, and moderate to high alcohol consumption (11.692167191103168 units/week) contribute to an increased risk of CKD.
8. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, suggests managed but ongoing kidney issues.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Management of hypertension, glucose levels, and proteinuria, along with lifestyle modifications, is crucial to slow the progression of the disease.

The calculated risk score of 83/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided data:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major cause of kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure is elevated (134/104 mmHg), which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Reduced Kidney Function**: The patient's GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is 29.15 mL/min/1.73 m², indicating impaired kidney function. A GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is a diagnostic criterion for CKD.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.375789740458838 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 264.8589991783336 mg/g are indicative of kidney damage, a key component of CKD.
5. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors**: While the patient has a high BMI (35.39638139364226), which is a risk factor, the reported physical activity level is relatively high (9.42429109345487 hours/week), and there is adherence to medication (9.401506684729648/10). However, smoking and alcohol consumption (11.692167191103168 units/week) are detrimental to kidney health.
6. **Biochemical Parameters**: Elevated fasting glucose (121.76734012243324 mg/dL), HbA1c (5.271340934282413%), and creatinine (1.9948008969891111 mg/dL) levels, along with electrolyte imbalances (e.g., potassium at 5.104447864014288 mEq/L), contribute to the risk score.
7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are protective for kidney function in patients with proteinuria or diabetes, is noted. However, the concurrent use of NSAIDs (3.362099994162744 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function.

The high risk score is primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as it increases the likelihood of developing high blood pressure, a major risk factor for CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: With a systolic BP of 134 mmHg and diastolic BP of 104 mmHg, the patient is hypertensive. High blood pressure is a leading cause of CKD as it damages the blood vessels in the kidneys over time.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 1.9948 mg/dL and a GFR of 29.15 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR is significantly lower than the normal range, suggesting a substantial loss of kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 4.375789740458838 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not leak significant amounts of protein into the urine.
5. **High Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)**: An ACR of 264.8589991783336 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the patient has some positive lifestyle factors such as a moderate level of physical activity, the high BMI (35.39638139364226), smoking, and relatively low diet quality contribute to the risk of CKD.
7. **Medications and Conditions**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are renoprotective, is beneficial. However, the absence of diabetes and previous AKI, alongside the presence of family kidney disease risk factors (though no direct family history of kidney disease), still positions the patient at a heightened risk due to other prevailing factors.

Overall, the combination of hypertension, evidence of kidney damage (proteinuria and elevated creatinine with reduced GFR), lifestyle factors, and the presence of other metabolic issues (such as high triglycerides and total cholesterol) significantly elevates the risk score for chronic kidney disease.",87,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided clinical and lifestyle data. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's blood pressure (158/107 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage kidneys over time.
3. **Previous UTIs**: The history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) may indicate underlying urinary tract issues that could potentially affect kidney health.
4. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: Although the HbA1c level is within a relatively normal range, the fasting glucose level (151.75 mg/dL) suggests impaired glucose regulation, which can be a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Electrolyte and Lab Values**: The patient's creatinine level (4.79 mg/dL) and BUN level (31.17 mg/dL) are within ranges that may indicate some degree of kidney impairment, though the GFR (111.09 mL/min/1.73 m²) is above the threshold for CKD stages 1-5. The protein in urine (0.2625 g/day) and ACR (69.01 mg/g) are also factors considered in the risk assessment.
6. **Medication Use**: The use of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed for conditions like hypertension and proteinuria, indicates an effort to manage conditions that could impact kidney health but also suggests the presence of these conditions.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the diet quality is high (9.28/10) and the patient does not smoke, the alcohol consumption (13.24 units/week), relatively low physical activity (3.84 hours/week), and poor sleep quality (4.56/10) could negatively impact overall health and kidney function.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of hypertension in the family history increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (158/107 mmHg) are higher than the normal range, indicating hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Previous UTIs**: The history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) can increase the risk of CKD, as recurrent infections can cause kidney damage over time.
4. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level (4.789542633638981 mg/dL) and BUN level (31.16793770244407 mg/dL) are higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.2625458303953032 g/day) and an elevated ACR (69.00550191449753 mg/g) suggest kidney damage and increased risk of CKD progression.
6. **Medication Adherence and Health Literacy**: The low medication adherence (0.6319390956724702/10) and health literacy (0.1605057492208716/10) scores may hinder effective management of CKD risk factors and disease progression.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:

1. **Good Diet Quality**: A high diet quality score (9.276337194810736/10) can help reduce the risk of CKD progression.
2. **Normal Hemoglobin and Electrolyte Levels**: The hemoglobin (15.531677973567334 g/dL) and electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus) are within normal ranges, indicating no severe anemia or electrolyte imbalances that could exacerbate CKD.

* **Family history of hypertension**: This increases the risk of developing hypertension and subsequently CKD.
* **Previous UTIs**: Urinary tract infections can increase the risk of kidney damage and CKD.
* **Elevated blood pressure (158/107 mmHg)**: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for CKD.
* **Elevated fasting glucose (151.75 mg/dL)**: Although HbA1c is within normal range, the elevated fasting glucose level may indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD risk.
* **Abnormal kidney function tests**: The GFR is slightly elevated, but the creatinine level is high (4.79 mg/dL), and the BUN level is also elevated (31.17 mg/dL), indicating potential kidney impairment.
* **Protein in urine (0.26 g/day)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage.
* **Low medication adherence (6.32/10)**: Poor adherence to medication, including ACE inhibitors, may not effectively manage underlying conditions, such as hypertension, which can contribute to CKD progression.

However, some factors reduce the risk, such as:

* **Good diet quality (9.28/10)**: A healthy diet can help manage underlying conditions and reduce CKD risk.
* **No smoking**: Not smoking decreases the risk of CKD.
* **Regular physical activity (3.84 hours/week)**: Regular exercise can help manage blood pressure and reduce CKD risk.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided medical history and current health status. The main points contributing to this assessment include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease and Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of kidney disease and hypertension significantly increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Having had previous AKI episodes is a known risk factor for the development of CKD, as AKI can lead to permanent kidney damage.
3. **History of UTIs**: Recurrent urinary tract infections can cause or exacerbate kidney damage over time.
4. **Hypertension**: The elevated systolic blood pressure (165 mmHg) is a major risk factor for CKD, as uncontrolled hypertension can damage the kidneys.
5. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: The high creatinine level (4.284154676585568 mg/dL) and the low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 38.85093357535241 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function, which is a direct marker of CKD.
6. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.186890147326134 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (209.13631116712563 mg/g) are indicators of kidney damage.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Although the patient's BMI is within a relatively healthy range, the history of smoking, high alcohol intake, and low diet quality can all negatively impact kidney health.
8. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps can be indicative of CKD, although these symptoms are nonspecific and can be associated with many other conditions as well.

Given these factors, it is crucial for the patient to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage blood pressure, monitor kidney function, adjust lifestyle factors, and consider initiation of medications that protect the kidneys, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), if not contraindicated. Regular follow-up and adherence to treatment plans are essential to slow the progression of CKD.",87,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 87/100

The provided risk score is based on the comprehensive information given about the individual's health status, medical history, and lifestyle. Here are the main points that contribute to this risk score:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Previous AKI**: A history of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant risk factor for the development of CKD.
3. **Kidney Function Tests**: The individual's creatinine level (4.284154676585568 mg/dL) and GFR (38.85093357535241 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function, which is a key indicator of CKD.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of a significant amount of protein in the urine (4.186890147326134 g/day) and a high ACR (209.13631116712563 mg/g) are markers of kidney damage.
5. **Blood Pressure**: The elevated systolic blood pressure (165 mmHg) can further damage kidney function over time.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption are risk factors for CKD, although the provided alcohol consumption is near the upper limit of the given range.
7. **Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: The low diet quality and moderate physical activity level may not be optimal for maintaining kidney health.
8. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps can be indicative of CKD, although these symptoms can also be attributed to other conditions.

Given these factors, the risk score reflects a high likelihood of CKD, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly medical interventions to slow or halt disease progression. Regular check-ups and adherence to medication, if prescribed, are crucial. Improving diet quality, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking, and reducing alcohol consumption could also help mitigate the risk and progression of CKD.",87,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: **88/100**

The high risk score is based on several key factors:
- **Family history of hypertension**: Increases the risk of developing kidney disease.
- **Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)**: Indicates a pre-existing vulnerability in kidney function.
- **Elevated blood pressure (139/115 mmHg)**: Hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease.
- **High fasting glucose (148.38168878481994 mg/dL)**: Indicates possible diabetes or pre-diabetic conditions, which can damage kidneys.
- **Elevated creatinine (3.001994261753319 mg/dL) and BUN levels**: Suggest impaired kidney function.
- **High protein in urine (4.230733828974978 g/day) and ACR (25.438867635281134 mg/g)**: Proteinuria is a marker of kidney damage.
- **Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., high potassium levels)**: Can be a sign of kidney dysfunction.
- **Medications and medical history (e.g., use of NSAIDs, statins, and antidiabetic meds)**: While necessary for other conditions, these can impact kidney function, especially with long-term use.
- **Symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching**: Can be indicative of uremia or kidney dysfunction.
- **Health behaviors (e.g., relatively low diet quality, moderate physical activity)**: While better than sedentary lifestyles or very poor diet quality, there's room for improvement to mitigate risk factors.

Rationale – Key contributors to the high chronic‑kidney‑disease risk
Factor
Typical impact on CKD risk
How it applies to you
Age (77 y)
Advanced age is a major risk multiplier.
Adds ~+15 points.
Proteinuria (4.23 g/d)
>3.5 g/day indicates significant glomerular damage.
Adds ~+20 points.
Creatinine (3.0 mg/dL)
Markedly reduced kidney filtration; suggests stage 3–4 CKD.
Adds ~+15 points.
Blood pressure (139/115 mmHg)
Systolic‑dominant hypertension is a strong driver of CKD progression.
Adds ~+10 points.
NSAID use (≈9 ×/wk)
Chronic NSAID exposure accelerates renal decline.
Adds ~+10 points.
Previous AKI episode
A history of acute kidney injury elevates long‑term CKD risk.
Adds ~+10 points.
Anemia (Hb 10 g/dL)
Indicates reduced erythropoietin production from damaged kidneys.
Adds ~+5 points.
Hyperkalemia (K 5.27 mEq/L)
Reflects impaired potassium excretion, common in CKD.
Adds ~+5 points.
Modifiers that temper the score
Normal BMI and good sleep quality reduce overall risk slightly.
Low alcohol consumption and no smoking are protective.
No ACE‑inhibitor therapy may be a missed opportunity to slow progression (a neutral/negative modifier).
Combining these weighted contributions, the estimated risk of progressive chronic kidney disease in the next few years is high—hence the 82/100 score. It is advisable to pursue aggressive blood‑pressure control, consider a nephrology referral, and review NSAID use and medication adjustments.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and health behaviors. Main points contributing to this high risk score include:

* Previous history of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which increases the risk of developing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
* Family history of hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD
* Elevated blood pressure (139/115 mmHg), which is a major risk factor for CKD progression
* High levels of protein in the urine (4.23 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 25.44 mg/g, indicating kidney damage
* Elevated creatinine levels (3.00 mg/dL) and relatively low GFR (112.3 mL/min/1.73 m²) for the given age and sex
* Presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which are common symptoms associated with CKD
* High usage of NSAIDs (9.45 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and worsen kidney function
* Elevated fasting glucose (148.38 mg/dL) and HbA1c (4.91%), indicating impaired glucose regulation and potential diabetic nephropathy

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:
* High socioeconomic status and education level, which may facilitate better access to healthcare and health literacy
* Good water quality and lack of exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals
* Adherence to medication (7.58/10) and regular medical checkups (2.78/year)

Overall, while there are some positive factors, the presence of multiple CKD risk factors and symptoms contributes to a high risk score. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure, proteinuria, and glucose levels, as well as careful use of nephrotoxic medications, are essential to slow CKD progression.",87,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Factor
Observed Value
Why it raises CKD risk
Age
77 yr
CKD prevalence rises sharply after 70 yr.
Blood pressure
139/115 mmHg
Systolic ≥140 and diastolic ≥115 elevate renal vascular stress.
Prior AKI
Yes
History of acute injury strongly predicts chronic decline.
Proteinuria
4.23 g/day
Nephrotic‑range protein loss indicates significant glomerular damage.
Creatinine
3.00 mg/dL
Elevated serum creatinine reflects reduced filtration.
GFR
112 mL/min/1.73 m² (reported)
Although >60, the high creatinine suggests a potential measurement error or early CKD stage; a low or decreasing trend would be concerning.
NSAID use
9.5 times/week
Chronic NSAID exposure can worsen renal perfusion.
Anemia
Hb 10 g/dL
Reflects advanced kidney disease or chronic inflammation.
Elevated potassium
5.27 mEq/L
Hyperkalemia is common in CKD and signals reduced excretion.
Diabetes‑related metrics
Fasting glucose 148 mg/dL, HbA1c 4.9 %
Though HbA1c is low‑normal, the elevated glucose and antidiabetic medication use suggest glucose variability that can affect kidneys.
Lifestyle / exposures
High proteinuria but good water quality, moderate physical activity, low alcohol
Lifestyle is not a protective factor here; NSAID use dominates.
The score reflects a high‑moderate risk of progressive CKD, driven mainly by advanced age, uncontrolled hypertension, significant proteinuria, prior acute injury, and chronic NSAID exposure. Monitoring with serial eGFR, albuminuria, and blood‑pressure control is essential to prevent further decline.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various health parameters, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The main points that contribute to this risk score are:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg is above the normal range, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose**: A fasting glucose level of 177.4791356578748 mg/dL indicates impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing diabetes and subsequently CKD.
4. **High Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The creatinine level of 3.327000045309439 mg/dL and BUN level of 40.81305010432499 mg/dL are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function.
5. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (0.6679877994800776 g/day) is a marker of kidney damage and increases the risk of CKD progression.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalances**: The slightly elevated potassium level (5.387731346172126 mEq/L) may indicate impaired kidney function, as the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating electrolyte balances.
7. **Medications and Lifestyle**: The use of ACE inhibitors is appropriate for managing hypertension and proteinuria but does not negate the risk. The frequency of NSAIDs use (8.794474319295096 times/week) may potentially harm kidney function if not carefully monitored.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:
- **High Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: A diet quality score of 9.742875560126/10 and physical activity of 8.086080319094565 hours/week are protective factors against CKD.
- **Good Sleep Quality and Absence of Smoking**: High sleep quality (9.522646218901713/10) and not smoking are beneficial for overall health and kidney function.
- **Regular Medical Checkups and Good Medication Adherence**: Frequent medical checkups (1.7459893876127026/year) and high medication adherence (",74,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 73/100
Rationale – main points
Factor
Why it raises CKD risk
Blood pressure (171/73 mm Hg)
Systolic hypertension > 140 mm Hg is a primary driver of kidney damage.
Albuminuria / proteinuria (ACR ≈ 105 mg/g, 0.67 g/day)
Micro‑to‑macro‑albuminuria indicates glomerular injury and predicts rapid decline in GFR.
Elevated fasting glucose (≈ 177 mg/dL)
Even a single abnormal fasting value suggests impaired glucose control, a risk factor for diabetic kidney disease.
High NSAID use (≈ 9 times/week)
Chronic NSAID exposure can precipitate acute and chronic kidney injury, especially when combined with other nephrotoxic risk factors.
Moderate BMI (≈ 27)
Overweight status adds to cardiovascular strain and may accelerate CKD progression.
Elevated serum potassium (≈ 5.4 mEq/L)
Hyperkalemia can be an early sign of reduced renal reserve, often seen when GFR declines.
High fatigue score (≈ 9/10)
Symptom burden correlates with declining kidney function in this cohort.
ACE‑inhibitor therapy
Indicates existing hypertension or renal disease; while protective, it also flags pre‑existing risk.
Overall lab profile
Creatinine is high but GFR is reported > 100 mL/min/1.73 m²—an inconsistency that, if true, may reflect early compensatory hyperfiltration rather than true CKD stage; still, proteinuria and ACR are the stronger predictors.
Combining these elements, the individual’s risk of progressing to clinically significant chronic kidney disease over the next few years is estimated to be moderately high (≈ 70 % probability), translating to a 73 /100 risk score. Monitoring, tighter BP control, reduced NSAID use, and early diabetes management are strongly advised to lower this risk.

The provided risk score is based on an analysis of the given medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing conditions like kidney disease, as diabetes is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 171 mmHg is above the normal range, indicating hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Elevated Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level of 177.479 mg/dL and HbA1c of 5.856% suggest impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to the development of kidney disease.
4. **Kidney Function Indicators**: The creatinine level of 3.327 mg/dL and the presence of protein in the urine (0.6679877994800776 g/day) with an ACR of 104.95388040724666 mg/g indicate some level of kidney impairment.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: The elevated potassium level (5.387731346172126 mEq/L) could be indicative of kidney issues, as the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance.
6. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors suggests that there is an attempt to manage conditions like hypertension or proteinuria, which are risk factors for CKD.

The provided risk score is based on several key factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. Main points considered include:
- **Family History of Diabetes:** Yes, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
- **Blood Pressure:** Elevated systolic BP (171 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c:** Fasting glucose is slightly elevated (177.479 mg/dL), and HbA1c (5.856%) is near the upper limit of normal, indicating impaired glucose regulation, a risk factor for CKD.
- **Creatinine and GFR:** Creatinine is elevated (3.327 mg/dL), but GFR is surprisingly high (105.872 mL/min/1.73 m²), which might indicate muscle mass influence or other factors affecting creatinine levels.
- **Protein in Urine and ACR:** The presence of protein in the urine (0.6679877994800776 g/day) and an elevated ACR (104.95388040724666 mg/g) are strong indicators of kidney damage.
- **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile:** Some electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, but the lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk, a comorbidity with CKD.
- **Medications and Symptoms:** The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for CKD management, but the presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could indicate underlying issues affecting kidney function or be side effects of medications.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** High diet quality, good sleep quality, and moderate physical activity are positive factors, but a BMI of 27 indicates overweight status, which can increase CKD risk.

These factors collectively contribute to an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the high GFR value might suggest either an overestimation of kidney function due to muscle mass or other factors, or it could reflect a compensatory mechanism. Close monitoring and possibly reassessment of kidney function, along with managing blood pressure, glucose levels, and proteinuria, are recommended.",74,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 78/100
Brief Rationale
Factor
Impact on CKD Risk
Comment
Hypertension
+
Systolic 171 mmHg is markedly above the 90‑180 mmHg range. Uncontrolled BP drives progressive renal damage.
Hyperglycemia
+
Fasting glucose 177 mg/dL and HbA1c 5.86 % suggest impaired glucose tolerance; early diabetic nephropathy risk is elevated.
Proteinuria / ACR
+
0.67 g/day protein and ACR 105 mg/g are in the moderate‑to‑high range, a key predictor of CKD progression.
Elevated Creatinine
+
3.33 mg/dL is above normal, indicating impaired filtration despite the reported GFR.
Potassium
+
5.39 mEq/L is at the upper end of normal and may reflect early tubular dysfunction.
NSAID Use
+
8.8 times/week increases risk of acute tubular injury and worsens existing CKD.
Lifestyle
-
BMI 27 (over‑weight), moderate alcohol (11 units/wk) and high physical activity somewhat mitigate but do not offset other risks.
Family History
+
Diabetes in family increases susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease.
High HDL & LDL
neutral
Lipid profile not a primary CKD driver in this context.
Combining these elements, the patient shows several modifiable and non‑modifiable risk factors that elevate the likelihood of progressing to or having chronic kidney disease.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to the following factors:
- Elevated creatinine levels (4.637343950924747 mg/dL) and relatively low GFR (76.96457248403506 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function.
- High protein in urine (4.781223276193983 g/day) and ACR (278.5232322114829 mg/g) suggest significant kidney damage.
- History of UTIs, which can contribute to kidney damage over time.
- The presence of elevated fasting glucose (132.84766779389452 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.377360642670114%), indicating poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD.
- Elevated blood pressure readings, although the systolic BP is at the lower end of the range, the diastolic BP is higher than ideal, contributing to kidney strain.
- High BMI (28.168982192305386), which is associated with an increased risk of developing kidney disease.
- Low diet quality (3.1610158178282433/10) and moderate physical activity (9.043543402503143 hours/week) may contribute to the progression of CKD.
- The use of NSAIDs (4.686813346565555 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term use.
- Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a low QoL score (13.57966212342272/100), indicate a significant impact of CKD on quality of life.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on the provided clinical and demographic data. The main points contributing to this high risk score include:

1. **Existing Kidney Function Impairment**: The patient's GFR (Glucose Filtration Rate) of 76.96457248403506 mL/min/1.73 m², although still within a relatively normal range, is on the lower end, suggesting some degree of kidney function impairment. The elevated creatinine level (4.637343950924747 mg/dL) and significant proteinuria (4.781223276193983 g/day) with a high ACR (Albumin to Creatinine Ratio) of 278.5232322114829 mg/g further indicate compromised kidney function.

2. **Family and Medical History**: Although there is no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes mentioned, the presence of UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections) could indicate or contribute to kidney damage over time if not adequately managed.

3. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient has a high BMI (28.168982192305386), indicating obesity, which is a risk factor for developing CKD. The moderate alcohol consumption (11.32623243038209 units/week) and less-than-ideal diet quality (3.1610158178282433/10) may also contribute to CKD risk. The physical activity level is good, but other lifestyle factors may offset its benefits.

4. **Metabolic Factors**: Elevated fasting glucose (132.84766779389452 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.377360642670114%) levels suggest poor glucose control, indicative of diabetes or pre-diabetes, a significant risk factor for CKD. The lipid profile shows high total cholesterol and triglycerides, which can also contribute to CKD risk.

5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of significant itching (6.872734885761837/10), fatigue (3.0505949158535217/10), and nausea/vomiting (2.782819737732973 times/week) may indicate uremia or other complications of CKD, affecting the patient's quality of life.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease is high, primarily due to several key factors:
1. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated creatinine (4.637343950924747 mg/dL) and BUN (45.17924628884492 mg/dL) levels indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR (76.96457248403506 mL/min/1.73 m²) is near the lower end of the normal range, suggesting potential early-stage kidney impairment. High levels of protein in urine (4.781223276193983 g/day) and an elevated ACR (278.5232322114829 mg/g) are also indicative of kidney damage.
2. **Medical History and Symptoms**: A history of UTIs (Yes to UTIs) can increase the risk of kidney disease. Symptoms like fatigue (3.0505949158535217/10), nausea/vomiting (2.782819737732973 times/week), and itching (6.872734885761837/10) may suggest uremic symptoms which are associated with kidney dysfunction.
3. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: High BMI (28.168982192305386) and low diet quality (3.1610158178282433/10) can contribute to the development of kidney disease. While physical activity (9.043543402503143 hours/week) is relatively high, other lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption (11.32623243038209 units/week) may negatively impact kidney health.
4. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of NSAIDs (4.686813346565555 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with frequent use. The absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which are often used to manage conditions that can lead to kidney disease (e.g., hypertension, proteinuria), also contributes to the risk.
5. **Blood Pressure and Glucose Control**: While the systolic BP is low (96 mmHg), the diastolic BP is elevated (107 mmHg), indicating potential blood pressure dysregulation. Elevated fasting glucose (132.84766779389452 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.377360642670114%) suggest poor glucose control, increasing the risk of kidney disease.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several factors, including demographics, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The key points contributing to this risk score are:

1. **Laboratory Results**: Elevated creatinine (4.872915391645472 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (59.49424933157489 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. High levels of protein in urine (4.444082302654156 g/day) and an elevated ACR (114.094611374293 mg/g) also suggest kidney damage.
2. **Medical History and Physical Parameters**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and no previous AKI or UTIs, the presence of high fasting glucose (153.9446160540666 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.328913728533836%) levels may indicate prediabetes or diabetes, which are risk factors for CKD.
3. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: Smoking, moderate to high alcohol consumption (18.492673551954063 units/week), and poor diet quality (2.690139312444159/10) can contribute to the risk of CKD. The high level of physical activity (9.45366372629387 hours/week) is beneficial but may not sufficiently counteract other risk factors.

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Elevated Creatinine Levels**: A creatinine level of 4.872915391645472 mg/dL is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. **Reduced GFR**: A Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 59.49424933157489 mL/min/1.73 m² is below the normal range, suggesting kidney dysfunction.
3. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of 4.444082302654156 g/day of protein in the urine is a strong indicator of kidney damage.
4. **High ACR**: An Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 114.094611374293 mg/g further supports the presence of kidney damage.
5. **Family and Medical History**: While there's no mentioned family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the patient's current health metrics and lifestyle factors contribute to the risk.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, high alcohol consumption, poor diet quality, and limited physical activity contribute to the increased risk.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a poor quality of life score, suggests the impact of potential CKD on the patient's well-being.
8. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, poor medication adherence, and low health literacy may further exacerbate the risk or complicate the management of CKD.

These factors collectively indicate a significant risk for chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and possibly intervention to manage or slow the progression of kidney disease.",83,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Renal function – Creatinine is markedly elevated (≈ 4.9 mg/dL) and GFR is reduced (~ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), placing the patient in CKD stage 3a.
Proteinuria/ACR – 4.44 g/day of protein and an ACR of 114 mg/g are well above the thresholds for significant tubular injury and predict faster progression.
Metabolic risk – Fasting glucose (~154 mg/dL) and HbA1c (~6.3 %) indicate impaired glucose metabolism; even pre‑diabetes accelerates kidney decline.
Lifestyle factors – Regular NSAID use (≈ 3 ×/week), smoking, moderate alcohol intake, low diet quality, and poor sleep quality increase nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular risk.
Medication adherence & literacy – Low adherence (≈ 6.6/10) and very low health literacy (≈ 1.1/10) hamper optimal management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose control.
Environmental exposure – Poor water quality can introduce nephrotoxic contaminants.
Absence of protective meds – No ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, which would otherwise help preserve renal function.
Taken together, these factors suggest a high probability of CKD progression and cardiovascular complications, justifying a risk score around 78 /100.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is calculated based on various factors including demographic information, lifestyle, medical history, laboratory results, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

* Elevated creatinine levels (4.872915391645472 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (59.49424933157489 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (4.444082302654156 g/day) and elevated ACR (114.094611374293 mg/g), suggesting kidney damage.
* History of smoking and high alcohol consumption (18.492673551954063 units/week), which are risk factors for CKD.
* Poor diet quality (2.690139312444159/10) and low physical activity (9.45366372629387 hours/week), which can contribute to CKD progression.
* Family history of kidney disease is negative, but other factors such as high fasting glucose (153.9446160540666 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.328913728533836%) levels, and poor health behaviors (e.g., low medication adherence, poor health literacy) increase the risk.
* The use of statins may have a protective effect, but the overall risk profile is still concerning due to the presence of multiple risk factors.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Kidney Function**: The patient has a reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 59.49 mL/min/1.73 m², which is lower than the normal range (90-120 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function. The elevated Creatinine level (4.87 mg/dL) also suggests compromised kidney function.

2. **Protein in Urine and ACR**: The presence of protein in the urine (4.44 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 114.09 mg/g are indicators of kidney damage.

3. **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic (108 mmHg) and diastolic (84 mmHg) blood pressures are within a relatively normal range, they are on the higher end, which can be a risk factor for CKD progression.

4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated fasting glucose (153.94 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.33%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's smoking habit, moderate to high alcohol consumption (18.49 units/week), and poor diet quality (2.69/10) are lifestyle factors that can contribute to the risk of CKD.

6. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (2.84 times/week) without the protective effects of ACE inhibitors or diuretics may increase the risk of kidney damage. Poor medication adherence (6.60/10) and low health literacy (1.07/10) can also negatively impact CKD management.

7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue (8.96/10), itching (6.94/10), and muscle cramps (4.43 times/week) may indicate uremic symptoms associated with CKD. The poor quality of life score (37.26/100) also suggests a significant impact of CKD on daily life.

The high risk score is due to several factors, including:

* Previous AKI (Acute Kidney Injury), which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Elevated blood pressure (146/113 mmHg) and poor blood sugar control (HbA1c 9.78%), which are major risk factors for CKD
* Abnormal kidney function tests, including elevated creatinine (2.08 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (33.54 mL/min/1.73 m²)
* Presence of protein in urine (2.90 g/day) and high ACR (193.61 mg/g), indicating kidney damage
* History of smoking and low physical activity, which can exacerbate CKD
* Presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes (indicated by antidiabetic medication use and elevated HbA1c)

However, some factors that may mitigate the risk include:

* Good diet quality (9.36/10) and decent sleep quality (4.92/10)
* Good water quality and absence of heavy metal or occupational chemical exposure
* Regular medical check-ups (2.29 times/year) and relatively good medication adherence (5.42/10)

* Elevated blood pressure (146/113 mmHg) and high fasting glucose levels (113.2427120981802 mg/dL) with an HbA1c of 9.777984924753437%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes, a major risk factor for CKD
* Reduced kidney function as evidenced by a low GFR (33.540606164323364 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (2.0825699888424376 mg/dL) and BUN (47.70299624814076 mg/dL) levels
* Presence of protein in the urine (2.9032303411059757 g/day) and an elevated ACR (193.6055558348682 mg/g), indicating kidney damage
* Low physical activity (4.916467501114742 hours/week) and a high BMI (33.5724703524608), which can contribute to the progression of kidney disease
* Smoking and alcohol consumption, although moderate, also contribute to the risk
* History of nausea/vomiting and muscle cramps, which could be indicative of underlying issues related to kidney function or medication side effects
* The use of NSAIDs (7.774008085054879 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney disease

These factors collectively indicate a high risk for chronic kidney disease. Management and intervention strategies should focus on controlling blood pressure and diabetes, reducing proteinuria, avoiding nephrotoxic agents, and improving lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking cessation.

The calculated risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to the following factors:
- **Renal Function Indicators**: The patient has a history of previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a significant indicator of potential CKD risk. The current GFR of 33.54 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, categorizing the patient as having stage 3b CKD. Elevated creatinine and BUN levels further support impaired renal function.
- **Hypertension and Diabetes**: Although there's no family history of hypertension or diabetes, the patient's current systolic and diastolic blood pressure (146/113 mmHg) is elevated, and the HbA1c (9.78%) and fasting glucose (113.24 mg/dL) levels indicate poor glucose control, which are significant risk factors for CKD progression.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, low physical activity (4.92 hours/week), and a relatively high BMI (33.57) contribute to an increased risk. Despite a good diet quality score (9.36/10), the presence of other comorbidities and unhealthy behaviors offsets the benefits.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The patient experiences fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which can be related to kidney dysfunction and indicate a decreased quality of life. The QoL score of 81.77/100, while relatively high, is influenced by these symptoms.
- **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs and lack of protective medications like ACE inhibitors or statins may further increase the risk of CKD progression. Good adherence to prescribed medications is noted, but health literacy is relatively low, which could impact self-management of the condition.

Overall, the combination of impaired kidney function, hypertension, diabetes indicators, unhealthy lifestyle choices, and presence of symptoms suggestive of kidney issues all contribute to a high risk score for CKD.",87,African American,Black,"**Risk Score:** 86/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Previous UTIs**: The presence of previous Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) indicates potential kidney involvement and increases the risk of CKD.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: The creatinine level of 3.1773047925121927 mg/dL and a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of 27.276269734930843 mL/min/1.73 m² are indicative of impaired kidney function. A low GFR is a direct measure of kidney function, and values below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² are considered abnormal.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.4085637693887714 g/day) and an Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 4.223727656280851 mg/g suggest kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow large molecules like protein to pass through into the urine.
5. **Hypertension Management and Medications**: Although the current blood pressure is within a relatively controlled range, the use of ACE inhibitors without diuretics or other classes of antihypertensives may indicate a history of or current issues with blood pressure control, which is crucial in managing CKD.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high BMI (31.891101596622217) increases the risk of developing diabetes and hypertension, both of which are major risk factors for CKD. The relatively low level of physical activity (5.6521181995723815 hours/week) and moderate alcohol consumption (14.886736856434002 units/week) may also contribute to an increased risk.
7. **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: The presence of significant symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score (48.762363849252466/100), suggests a substantial impact of CKD on daily life, indicating advanced disease.

The patient's risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, primarily due to the following factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The patient has a family history of hypertension, which increases the risk of developing CKD.
2. **Previous UTIs**: The patient has a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can increase the risk of CKD.
3. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: The patient's creatinine level is high (3.18 mg/dL) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is low (27.28 mL/min/1.73 m²), indicating impaired kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: The patient has a significant amount of protein in their urine (2.41 g/day), which is a marker of kidney damage.
5. **Hypertension**: Although the patient's current blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the history of hypertension in the family and the presence of other risk factors contribute to the overall risk.
6. **High HbA1c**: The patient's HbA1c level is elevated (9.14%), indicating poor glucose control, which can contribute to kidney damage over time.
7. **Medication Use**: The patient is taking ACE inhibitors, which can be beneficial for CKD management, but the use of NSAIDs (7.73 times/week) may be detrimental to kidney function.

However, some factors mitigate the risk, such as:
- The patient's relatively good diet quality (4.96/10) and sleep quality (6.96/10).
- The absence of smoking and relatively moderate alcohol consumption.
- The patient's high socioeconomic status and access to higher education, which can positively influence health outcomes.

Overall, while there are both risk-increasing and risk-reducing factors, the patient's current kidney function indicators (creatinine, GFR, proteinuria) and medical history place them at a high risk for CKD progression.",83,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 84/100
Rationale – Key risk contributors
Factor
Observation
Impact on CKD risk
Age
68 years
Age >65 adds ~15 points for CKD progression risk.
GFR
27.3 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 3b)
Severe reduction in filtration strongly predicts worsening kidney function.
Proteinuria
2.4 g/day
Heavy protein loss drives glomerular injury and accelerates decline.
Blood glucose / HbA1c
149.9 mg/dL, 9.14%
Uncontrolled diabetes is the leading cause of CKD and increases progression risk.
Hypertension family history
Yes
Genetic predisposition elevates risk of renal damage.
NSAID use
~8 ×/week
Chronic NSAID exposure is nephrotoxic and aggravates proteinuria.
Medication
On ACE inhibitor (beneficial) but no statin
Statin therapy can improve cardiovascular outcomes, which is closely tied to kidney health.
Lifestyle
BMI ~32 (obese), moderate alcohol, moderate physical activity
Obesity and excess alcohol modestly heighten CKD risk.
Urinary ACR
4.22 mg/g (near-normal)
Low ACR may under‑estimate early microalbuminuria but heavy albumin in 24‑h protein suggests ongoing glomerular leak.
Symptoms
Fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, itching
Indicative of uremic toxin accumulation, reinforcing advanced CKD.
Health behaviors
Low medical‑checkup frequency (~0.2/year) and moderate medication adherence
Infrequent monitoring can delay detection of worsening kidney function.
These factors collectively produce a high probability of CKD progression and associated complications, justifying a risk score of 84 out of 100.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high due to several factors:

- **Age and Gender**: As a 70-year-old male, age is a significant risk factor for CKD, and males are generally at higher risk than females.
- **Blood Pressure**: Although the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values (98/87 mmHg) are within a relatively normal range, the presence of other risk factors contributes to the overall risk.
- **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (102.2729590977625 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.920346739847984%) indicate impaired glucose regulation, suggesting either diabetes or prediabetes, both of which are major risk factors for CKD.
- **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (4.875003236477069 mg/dL) and GFR (48.0447687623283 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate compromised kidney function. The protein in urine (4.49420453560006 g/day) and ACR (67.41452486460128 mg/g) are also elevated, indicating kidney damage.
- **Lifestyle and Medical History**: Smoking, high alcohol consumption, and a history of using diuretics and antidiabetic medications further increase the risk. Although diet quality is good, the high BMI (32.77469853659207) and low physical activity level (4.325742650033506 hours/week) are detrimental.
- **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of significant fatigue, itching, and muscle cramps, along with a low QoL score (48.059889284860645/100), suggests that CKD is already impacting quality of life.

While the provided data does not indicate a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, and there's no history of previous AKI or UTIs, the combination of age, impaired glucose regulation, compromised kidney function, lifestyle factors, and symptoms contributes to a high risk score for CKD.",83,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

The calculated risk score indicates a moderate to high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated creatinine level (4.875 mg/dL) and relatively low GFR (48.044 mL/min/1.73 m²), both of which are indicators of impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (4.494 g/day) and an elevated ACR (67.414 mg/g), suggesting kidney damage.
* History of diabetes is implied by the use of antidiabetic medications and a high HbA1c level (8.920%), which increases the risk of CKD.
* High BMI (32.774), which is a risk factor for developing CKD, especially in combination with diabetes.
* Suboptimal diet quality (9.327/10) and physical activity level (4.325 hours/week), which can exacerbate risk factors for CKD.
* Smoking and alcohol consumption, although the latter is relatively moderate (11.158 units/week), can also contribute to kidney damage.
* Symptoms such as fatigue (9.641/10) and itching (9.137/10) may indicate advanced kidney disease, though their presence alone is not diagnostic.
* Lower than ideal medication adherence (2.935/10) and health literacy (1.805/10) could hinder effective management of risk factors and existing conditions.
* The absence of ACE inhibitors, which are beneficial in slowing CKD progression, especially in patients with proteinuria or diabetes, is notable.
* The presence of diuretics and antidiabetic medications suggests management of hypertension and diabetes but may also indicate presence of these conditions which are risk factors for CKD.

Given these factors, a comprehensive approach to managing CKD risk is necessary, including lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and regular monitoring of kidney function and risk factors. Consultation with healthcare professionals for personalized advice and management is crucial.",73,Caucasian,Hispanic,"Risk Score: 82/100
Rationale
Established CKD – eGFR of 48 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 3a) and proteinuria of 4.5 g/day already indicate significant kidney damage.
Diabetes with poor control – HbA1c of 8.9 % and fasting glucose ~102 mg/dL increase progression risk.
High NSAID exposure – 9 uses per week can further injure the kidneys.
Obesity (BMI ≈ 32.8) and smoking add metabolic and vascular stress.
Low medication adherence (2.9/10) and lack of ACE‑inhibitor/ARB therapy reduce protective effects on the kidney.
Elevated albumin‑creatinine ratio (67 mg/g) signals ongoing glomerular injury.
Symptom burden (fatigue, itching, muscle cramps) reflects advanced disease and impaired homeostasis.
All these factors together point to a high probability of CKD progression and associated complications, warranting aggressive management and close follow‑up.

The provided information indicates a moderate to high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points supporting this assessment include:

1. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated creatinine (2.54 mg/dL) and BUN (38.67 mg/dL) levels, alongside a relatively high proteinuria (1.53 g/day) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 169.34 mg/g, suggest impaired kidney function. The GFR of 116.66 mL/min/1.73 m² is within the normal range but should be interpreted with caution given the other indicators.

2. **Blood Pressure**: Although the current blood pressure (92/69 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of other risk factors for kidney disease is concerning.

3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (158.97 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.77%) levels indicate poorly controlled diabetes, a significant risk factor for CKD.

4. **Electrolytes and Lipid Profile**: While the electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, the lipid profile shows high total cholesterol (247.04 mg/dL) and triglycerides (352.24 mg/dL), which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and, by extension, renal risk.

5. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, significant fatigue, frequent nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a reduced quality of life score (54.15/100), suggests a substantial impact of kidney dysfunction on daily life.

6. **Lifestyle and Exposures**: Smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and occupational chemical exposure are additional risk factors that could exacerbate kidney damage.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency, can be harmful to kidney function, especially in the context of existing kidney issues. Good medication adherence and health literacy are positive factors but may not offset the cumulative effect of other risk factors.

Given these considerations, the calculated risk score reflects a significant likelihood of chronic kidney disease progression, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and potentially therapeutic interventions to slow disease progression.",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 72/100
Rationale
Domain
Key Findings
Impact on CKD Risk
Demographics
Age 57, female
Age contributes moderately; females generally have slightly lower risk, but age 57 still raises baseline risk.
Body & Lifestyle
BMI 30 (obese), smoker, alcohol 14 u/week, 9.5 h physical activity, diet 6.5/10, sleep 8.8/10
Obesity and smoking are independent CKD risk factors; alcohol and good sleep mitigate slightly.
Metabolic Control
Fasting glucose 159 mg/dL, HbA1c 7.8%
Indicates undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes, a major driver of kidney damage.
Renal Function
Creatinine 2.54 mg/dL, GFR 117 mL/min/1.73 m² (likely over‑estimation), proteinuria 1.53 g/day, ACR 169 mg/g
Persistent proteinuria and high ACR strongly predict progressive kidney injury despite a seemingly normal GFR value.
Blood Pressure
92/69 mmHg
Low systolic/diastolic may reflect early renal dysfunction or volume depletion; not a protective factor here because of other renal findings.
Electrolytes & Labs
Mild hyperphosphatemia, normal sodium, potassium, calcium
Hyperphosphatemia can signal early CKD, but within a narrow margin.
Medication / Exposure
NSAID use 3.7 ×/week, no ACEi/diuretics/stats
Frequent NSAIDs increase nephrotoxicity risk.
Symptoms & QoL
Edema, fatigue, muscle cramps, itching, QoL 54/100
Signs of fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and uremic pruritus typical in CKD progression.
Overall assessment:The combination of high fasting glucose/HbA1c, significant proteinuria/ACR, NSAID exposure, and moderate obesity places the patient at a moderate‑high risk for chronic kidney disease progression. Thus, a 72 / 100 risk score reflects substantial concern while acknowledging that some protective factors (good sleep, moderate activity) are present.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Elevated creatinine (2.54 mg/dL) and BUN levels (38.67 mg/dL), indicating impaired kidney function.
* Presence of protein in urine (1.53 g/day) and high ACR (169.34 mg/g), suggesting kidney damage.
* Family history of kidney disease is denied, but family history of hypertension and diabetes is also denied, which slightly reduces the risk.
* The patient's fasting glucose (158.97 mg/dL) and HbA1c (7.77%) levels are elevated, indicating poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for kidney disease.
* The patient's BMI (30.21) and triglycerides (352.24 mg/dL) are high, contributing to the risk of kidney disease.
* The patient has a history of smoking and consumes a moderate amount of alcohol, which may contribute to kidney damage.
* The patient's physical activity (9.46 hours/week) and diet quality (6.53/10) are relatively good, but may not be sufficient to offset other risk factors.
* The patient's symptoms, such as edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, may be related to kidney disease, but their frequency and severity are not extremely high.
* The patient's medication adherence (9.88/10) and health literacy (8.17/10) are good, but the use of NSAIDs (3.76 times/week) may be a concern due to their potential nephrotoxic effects.

Overall, the patient's risk score is high due to the presence of kidney damage markers, poor glucose control, and lifestyle factors that contribute to kidney disease risk.

Rationale (Key points)
Category
Relevant Findings
Impact on CKD risk
Diabetes
Fasting glucose ≈ 159 mg/dL, HbA1c ≈ 7.8 %
Uncontrolled glycaemia is the leading cause of CKD; strongly elevates risk.
Proteinuria & ACR
1.53 g/24 h protein, ACR 169 mg/g
Markers of glomerular injury; >1 g/day or ACR > 300 mg/g denotes advanced disease, but 169 mg/g already places patient in high‑risk category.
Serum creatinine
2.54 mg/dL
Indicates reduced filtration; despite a reported GFR of 116 mL/min/1.73 m² (likely a calculation error or acute rise), the creatinine level itself signals early CKD.
Lipid profile
LDL 136 mg/dL, HDL 21 mg/dL, TG 352 mg/dL
Dyslipidaemia contributes to atherosclerosis and renal vascular damage.
Lifestyle factors
BMI ≈ 30 kg/m², smoking, moderate alcohol, NSAID use ~4×/wk
All exacerbate renal insult and accelerate disease progression.
Hypertension history
Systolic 92 mmHg (low) – not a risk factor here, but hypotension may reflect advanced renal disease.

Occupational chemical exposure
Yes
Certain chemicals (e.g., solvents, heavy metals) can be nephrotoxic.
Symptom burden
Edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching
Common manifestations of advanced CKD, indicating functional compromise.
Combining these factors, the patient has a high probability of established CKD (likely stage 3 or higher) with a significant likelihood of progression within the next 5–10 years. The risk score of 78/100 reflects the cumulative impact of metabolic derangements, proteinuria, and lifestyle exposures.

The high risk score is due to several key factors:

* Elevated creatinine level (2.54 mg/dL) and protein in urine (1.53 g/day) indicate impaired kidney function.
* High blood glucose levels (Fasting Glucose: 158.97 mg/dL, HbA1c: 7.77%) suggest diabetes, a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching are common symptoms associated with CKD.
* Although the GFR (116.66 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range, the combination of other factors still poses a significant risk.
* Lack of medication adherence to manage potential underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and relatively low health literacy may exacerbate the risk.
* The patient's lifestyle, including smoking and high alcohol consumption, further increases the risk of developing CKD.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring and management of the underlying conditions, as well as lifestyle modifications, are essential to mitigate this risk.",83,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 84/100

Category
Key Findings
Impact on CKD risk
Demographics
57 yr, Black, middle‑income, bachelor’s degree
Black ethnicity and age >50 raise baseline CKD susceptibility.
Anthropometrics
BMI ≈30 kg/m²
Obesity is a major metabolic risk factor for kidney disease.
Lifestyle
Smokes, 14 units alcohol/week, 9.5 h physical activity, 6.5/10 diet, 8.8/10 sleep
Smoking and high alcohol use increase vascular damage; diet score moderate, but overall lifestyle is only partially protective.
Metabolic profile
Fasting glucose 159 mg/dL, HbA1c 7.8 %
Indicates poorly controlled pre‑diabetes/diabetes, a leading cause of CKD.
Renal function
Creatinine 2.5 mg/dL, GFR 117 mL/min/1.73 m² (likely a calculation artifact), Protein 1.5 g/day, ACR 169 mg/g
Persistent proteinuria and elevated albumin‑to‑creatinine ratio signal significant glomerular damage despite the reported GFR.
Blood pressure
92/69 mmHg
Low systolic may reflect volume loss; diastolic within normal range but chronic hypertension was not documented; nevertheless, any BP abnormality can exacerbate kidney injury.
Electrolytes & Hematology
Mild hyperphosphatemia, anemia (Hb 11.4 g/dL)
Anemia and mineral‑balance disturbances are common in CKD progression.
Lipid profile
Total cholesterol 247 mg/dL, LDL 136, HDL 21, triglycerides 352 mg/dL
Dyslipidemia contributes to atherosclerosis, worsening renal perfusion.
Medication & Exposure
NSAID use ~4 × week, occupational chemical exposure
NSAIDs and toxic exposures accelerate renal damage.
Symptoms & QoL
Edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, QoL 54/100
These signs correlate with established CKD and its complications.
Health behaviors
1.3 medical checkups/year, 9.9/10 medication adherence, 8.2/10 health literacy
Good adherence may mitigate but does not offset the strong risk profile.
Overall assessment:The combination of significant proteinuria/ACR, hyperglycemia/HbA1c, obesity, smoking, NSAID use, dyslipidemia, and symptoms consistent with renal dysfunction places this patient at a high CKD risk. A score of 84/100 reflects a substantial likelihood of progression to moderate/severe CKD if these factors are not modified promptly.

Rationale – Key Risk Contributors
Renal function indicators – eGFR of 53 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD stage 3a) and proteinuria 2.1 g/day (heavy) signify active kidney damage.
Albuminuria – ACR of 162 mg/g (macro‑albuminuria) strongly correlates with progression to ESRD.
Hypertension – Systolic BP of 177 mmHg indicates uncontrolled isolated systolic hypertension, a primary driver of CKD progression.
Prediabetes/Impaired glucose – Fasting glucose 125 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.76 % place the patient in the high‑risk pre‑diabetic/diabetic range, accelerating renal decline.
Obesity (BMI 36.3) and smoking (daily) contribute to vascular damage and reduced renal perfusion.
History of AKI & UTIs – Prior acute kidney injury and recurrent urinary infections heighten susceptibility to chronic damage.
NSAID use – 4.5 times/week can worsen renal perfusion and interstitial inflammation.
Lipid profile – Triglycerides 379 mg/dL and LDL 97 mg/dL add atherosclerotic burden to renal vasculature.
Lifestyle factors – Poor sleep quality (4.1/10) and moderate medication adherence (~1.5/10) may limit effective disease management.

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for CKD, contributes to the increased risk score.
2. **Previous AKI and UTIs**: A history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) can indicate or contribute to kidney damage, increasing the risk of CKD.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (177 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The high fasting glucose (125.00865777504212 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.755754721205159%) levels suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The slightly elevated creatinine level (1.029440537002161 mg/dL) and decreased GFR (53.15412574891359 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate some level of kidney impairment. The presence of protein in the urine (2.1140244107050994 g/day) and a high albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 161.85702645788314 mg/g further support kidney damage.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking and high alcohol consumption contribute to the risk of CKD, although the alcohol consumption is at the higher end of moderate drinking.
7. **Other Health Conditions**: The presence of conditions like hypertension (suggested by the need to consider blood pressure) and possibly pre-diabetes or diabetes (given the glucose and HbA1c levels) also contribute to the risk.

However, factors such as good diet quality and physical activity level somewhat mitigate the risk. The overall risk score reflects a combination of these factors, indicating a significant risk for CKD that warrants monitoring and possibly intervention to reduce risk factors and slow disease progression.",73,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 83/100**

Very high risk of progression and complications

Serum creatinine 4.05 mg/dL
Strong indicator of reduced filtration
Albuminuria / proteinuria
ACR 87 mg/g; protein 4.48 g/day
Major predictor of decline; >3 g/day is severe
Metabolic profile
HbA1c 8.78 % and fasting glucose 116 mg/dL
Poor glycemic control accelerates nephron loss

Triglycerides 175 mg/dL; LDL 147 mg/dL
Atherogenic profile increases vascular renal damage
Blood pressure & medication
BP 97/77 mmHg (normotensive but borderline low); on ACE inhibitor
ACEi is protective but underlying hypertension risk remains due to family history
Lifestyle
Smoking (yes); NSAID use ~3.6 ×/week
Both increase glomerular injury risk
Symptoms & QoL
Fatigue 6.5/10; nausea 4×/week; mild itching
Suggests fluid overload and uremic toxin buildup
Other risk modifiers
Age 31 – younger but early onset CKD is concerning; family history of hypertension but no kidney disease
Adds to long‑term cumulative risk
Protective factors
BMI 21.5 (normal); diet quality 6.5/10; adequate physical activity 6.4 h/week
Moderately offset some risk
Why the score is 88/100
The combination of Stage 4 CKD (low eGFR) and heavy proteinuria places the patient in a high‑risk category for rapid progression.
Elevated HbA1c and lipid levels amplify renal injury through microvascular damage.
Frequent NSAID use and smoking further stress the kidneys.
Despite normal blood pressure, the family history of hypertension and current ACE‑inhibitor therapy reflect underlying vascular risk.
The high symptom burden and low QoL score indicate significant disease impact.
Overall, the data point to a very high risk of CKD progression and related complications, warranting aggressive monitoring and multidisciplinary management.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 83/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Low GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: A GFR of 28.15852208032437 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates significantly impaired kidney function. GFR is a critical measure of kidney health, and values below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: High levels of creatinine (4.053272313726492 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (31.740445635855988 mg/dL) further indicate reduced kidney function, as these waste products accumulate in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly.

3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 4.479282128606109 g/day of protein in the urine is a marker of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow significant amounts of protein to pass through into the urine.

4. **Family History of Hypertension**: While there is no family history of kidney disease, the presence of hypertension in the family can indirectly increase the risk of developing kidney disease due to hypertension's role as a major risk factor for CKD.

5. **Current Health Status**: The patient's current systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and HbA1c levels, although not exceedingly high, in combination with other factors, contribute to an overall increased risk.

6. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors**: Smoking, although not heavily (implied by ""Yes to smoking"" without quantity), and moderate alcohol consumption (1.0772422891019295 units/week) can exacerbate kidney problems. The patient's physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality are relatively good but may not sufficiently counterbalance the other risk factors.

7. **Medications**: The use of ACE inhibitors is beneficial for patients with kidney disease, especially those with proteinuria, as it helps to slow the progression of kidney disease. However, the concurrent use of NSAIDs, even at a moderate frequency (3.581075551347086 times/week), can be harmful to kidney function and may counteract some of the protective effects of ACE inhibitors.

Given these factors, the patient is at a significantly increased risk for chronic kidney disease progression",83,Caucasian,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

**Rationale**

- **Severe renal impairment**: Creatinine 4.05 mg/dL and GFR 28 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate advanced CKD (Stage 3b), which is a major determinant of a high overall risk score.  
- **Marked proteinuria**: 4.48 g/day and ACR 87 mg/g are strongly associated with progression to end‑stage kidney disease.  
- **Uncontrolled hyperglycemia**: HbA1c 8.78 % and fasting glucose >110 mg/dL point to poorly managed",82.0,Caucasian,Hispanic

* Elevated systolic blood pressure (154 mmHg) and fasting glucose level (109.3 mg/dL), indicating potential hypertension and prediabetes, respectively
* Reduced renal function, as indicated by a GFR of 68.64 mL/min/1.73 m², which is below the normal range
* Presence of protein in the urine (1.02 g/day) and an elevated ACR (187.91 mg/g), suggesting kidney damage
* Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney disease
* High BMI (34.22), which is associated with an increased risk of CKD
* Fair physical activity level (7.15 hours/week) and moderate sleep quality (7.27/10), which may contribute to an increased risk of CKD

However, the following factors help mitigate the risk:
* Good diet quality (9.68/10)
* High HDL cholesterol level (79.08 mg/dL)
* Regular medical checkups (3.76 times/year) and good medication adherence (6.20/10)
* Good health literacy (0.85/10)

The provided risk score is based on the individual's medical history, lifestyle, and current health status. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (154/92 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney structures over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Although not in the diabetic range, the fasting glucose level (109.3280967286594 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.435274646461694%) are on the higher side, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to kidney damage.
4. **Kidney Function**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 68.63716177378171 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates mildly impaired kidney function. The presence of protein in the urine (1.0204583937033047 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 187.91297889765428 mg/g further suggest kidney damage.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: A high body mass index (BMI) of 34.22450488071574, moderate alcohol consumption (11.167842326573474 units/week), and physical activity level (7.151013387624671 hours/week), although not extremely concerning, contribute to the overall risk when combined with other factors.
6. **Medications and Exposures**: The use of diuretics and NSAIDs, as well as occupational chemical exposure, may also impact kidney function.
7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue, itching, and a moderate quality of life score (64.23900639604378/100) can be indicative of underlying kidney issues affecting daily life.

These factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring of kidney function, management of blood pressure and glucose levels, lifestyle modifications (including weight management, increased physical activity, and reduced alcohol consumption), and adherence to medications as prescribed are crucial to mitigate this risk.",73,African American,Black,"Risk Score: 72/100

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several factors:

* **Family history**: Presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
* **Blood pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (154/92 mmHg) increases the risk of kidney damage.
* **Fasting glucose and HbA1c**: Slightly elevated fasting glucose (109.33 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.44%) levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, which can contribute to CKD.
* **Kidney function**: Reduced GFR (68.64 mL/min/1.73 m²) and elevated creatinine (1.38 mg/dL) and BUN (34.12 mg/dL) levels suggest impaired kidney function.
* **Protein in urine**: Presence of protein in urine (1.02 g/day) and elevated ACR (187.91 mg/g) indicate kidney damage.
* **Electrolytes and lipids**: Abnormal levels of certain electrolytes and lipids, such as elevated total cholesterol (255.54 mg/dL) and triglycerides (280.19 mg/dL), can contribute to CKD risk.
* **Medications and lifestyle**: Use of diuretics and NSAIDs, which can be nephrotoxic, and a relatively low diet quality (9.68/10) may also contribute to the increased risk.
* **Symptoms and quality of life**: Presence of edema, fatigue, and itching, as well as a reduced QoL score (64.24/100), may indicate underlying kidney disease.

However, some factors, such as good water quality, absence of heavy metals exposure, and high health literacy, may mitigate the risk to some extent. Nevertheless, the overall risk score suggests a significant likelihood of developing or progressing CKD, and regular monitoring and management of risk factors are essential to prevent or slow disease progression.",73,African American,Hispanic,"**Risk Score: 72/100**

The provided risk score is based on the analysis of various factors related to the patient's health and medical history. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History of Diabetes**: The presence of a family history of diabetes is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD.

2. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's blood pressure (141/119 mmHg) is elevated, which is a major risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.

3. **Kidney Function Tests**: Although the patient's GFR (107.137 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within a relatively normal range, the creatinine level (2.0677052493147157 mg/dL) is slightly elevated, and the BUN level (46.7506442849242 mg/dL) is near the upper limit of the normal range. These indicators suggest some level of kidney stress or dysfunction.

4. **Protein in Urine (ACR 174.84673665172642 mg/g)**: The presence of protein in the urine is a key indicator of kidney damage and a significant risk factor for CKD progression.

5. **Electrolyte and Mineral Levels**: The patient's potassium level (5.310603330365142 mEq/L) is at the upper limit of the normal range, which can be concerning for kidney function, as the kidneys play a crucial role in potassium regulation.

6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's smoking habit and moderate alcohol consumption, despite being relatively low, still pose health risks, including to kidney health. The patient's BMI (28.178709540631615) indicates overweight status, which is a risk factor for developing conditions like diabetes and hypertension, both of which can lead to CKD.

7. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of edema, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, along with a significant impact on quality of life (QoL Score: 24.44105000008525/100), suggests that the patient is experiencing symptoms that could be related to kidney dysfunction or other underlying health issues.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 87/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Impaired Kidney Function**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is 25.36 mL/min/1.73 m², which indicates severely impaired kidney function. A normal GFR is approximately 120 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, and a GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is generally considered to be indicative of CKD.

2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of significant protein in the urine (4.764 g/day) and a high Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR of 287.58 mg/g) is a strong indicator of kidney damage, which is a hallmark of CKD.

3. **Hypertension**: Although the systolic blood pressure (119 mmHg) is not significantly elevated, the diastolic blood pressure (106 mmHg) is higher than normal, and there is a family history of hypertension. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD, as it can damage the kidneys over time.

4. **Hyperglycemia**: The patient's fasting glucose level (168.91 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.64%) indicate poor control of blood sugar levels. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD, and the evidence of hyperglycemia suggests an increased risk.

5. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors**: While some lifestyle factors such as physical activity (9.55 hours/week) and sleep quality (8.7/10) are relatively good, the patient smokes and has a moderate alcohol intake (10.84 units/week), which can negatively impact kidney health. The patient's diet quality is fair (6.17/10), which could be improved to better manage CKD risk factors.

6. **Family History**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing hypertension and, consequently, CKD.

7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (3.67 times/week) can be nephrotoxic and further compromise kidney function, especially in the context of pre-existing kidney impairment. Although the patient is on statins, which can have protective effects on cardiovascular health, the overall medication and health behavior profile contributes to an increased risk",87,Asian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

**Rationale – Main Points**

1. **Renal Function & Proteinuria**  
   - eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73 m² (Stage 3b CKD) and protein excretion 4.8 g/day are severe indicators of existing kidney damage.  
   - ACR 287 mg/g is near the upper limit of the “moderately increased” range, reflecting substantial glomerular injury.

2. **Blood Pressure & Vascular Risk**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily driven by several key factors:
1. **Elevated Creatinine and Reduced GFR**: A creatinine level of 2.8963851757888817 mg/dL and a GFR of 25.36058793280086 mL/min/1.73 m² indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR is significantly below the normal range, suggesting severe kidney impairment.
2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of 4.764195948282511 g/day of protein in the urine and an ACR of 287.58403540010016 mg/g are indicative of significant kidney damage, as healthy kidneys would not allow large amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
3. **Hypertension**: Although the systolic BP is within a relatively controlled range, the diastolic BP is elevated at 106 mmHg, which is a risk factor for CKD progression.
4. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
5. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: Smoking and consuming 10.8440877743863 units of alcohol per week can exacerbate kidney damage and contribute to the progression of CKD.
6. **Laboratory Values**: Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels suggest poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD. The lipid profile shows high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, which can contribute to cardiovascular risk and potentially affect kidney health.
7. **Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of advanced kidney disease, affecting the quality of life and potentially reflecting uremic symptoms.

While the patient has some protective factors such as a good diet quality, high physical activity, and adherence to medications, the presence of significant kidney dysfunction indicators outweighs these positive aspects, leading to a high risk score for CKD.",87,Asian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to several key factors:

1. **Impaired Kidney Function**: The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is significantly low at 25.36058793280086 mL/min/1.73 m², which is a direct indicator of reduced kidney function.
2. **Proteinuria**: The presence of a high amount of protein in the urine (4.764195948282511 g/day) and an elevated Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 287.58403540010016 mg/g suggest significant kidney damage.
3. **Hypertension**: Although the systolic blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the diastolic blood pressure is elevated at 106 mmHg, which can still pose a risk for kidney damage, especially in the context of pre-existing kidney issues.
4. **Family History of Hypertension**: A positive family history of hypertension increases the risk of developing hypertension and, by extension, CKD.
5. **Poor Glycemic Control**: The patient's fasting glucose level (168.90944081258112 mg/dL) and HbA1c (9.635862178033456%) indicate poor blood sugar control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
6. **Smoking and Alcohol Consumption**: The patient's smoking habit and significant alcohol consumption (10.8440877743863 units/week) are additional risk factors that can exacerbate kidney disease.

However, the patient's good sleep quality, relatively high physical activity level, and adherence to medication regimens are positive factors that might help mitigate some of the risks associated with CKD.

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined based on several key factors from the provided data:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as it increases the likelihood of developing high blood pressure, a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Hypertension**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (163 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. Hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys over time, reducing their ability to function properly.
3. **Kidney Function Indicators**: Although the GFR (105.92761828950916 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within a relatively normal range, the presence of protein in the urine (2.221829738974871 g/day) and an elevated ACR (149.34142415355146 mg/g) suggests kidney damage or disease, as these are indicators of kidney function impairment.
4. **Medications and Substances**: The use of NSAIDs (8.971378215476427 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term or high-frequency use, as it can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and cause damage over time.
5. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the patient has a healthy BMI and good sleep quality, the presence of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption (5.9119824996975705 units/week) can negatively impact overall health, including kidney health.
6. **Diet and Physical Activity**: The patient's diet quality is moderate (4.437593777803355/10), and physical activity is somewhat low (1.3636565385124133 hours/week), which can contribute to a higher risk of developing conditions like hypertension and diabetes, both risk factors for CKD.
7. **Blood Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose level (101.32032702130516 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.412861353025537%) are slightly elevated, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which can be a risk factor for CKD if not managed properly.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical data. The main points contributing to this score include:

* Elevated systolic blood pressure (163 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (64 mmHg), which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and can also impact kidney health.
* Presence of protein in the urine (2.22 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 149.34 mg/g, indicating kidney damage.
* Family history of hypertension, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease.
* Elevated creatinine levels (2.48 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (35.94 mg/dL), suggesting impaired kidney function.
* Borderline elevated fasting glucose (101.32 mg/dL) and HbA1c (8.41%), indicating potential prediabetes or diabetes, which can contribute to kidney disease.
* Low medication adherence (7.85/10) and health literacy (4.60/10), which can impact the effectiveness of treatment and disease management.
* Frequent NSAID use (8.97 times/week), which can be nephrotoxic and exacerbate kidney damage.

However, factors that mitigate the risk include:

* High socioeconomic status and education level, which can facilitate access to better healthcare and healthier lifestyle choices.
* Good water quality and lack of exposure to heavy metals or occupational chemicals, reducing environmental risks.
* Relatively high physical activity (1.36 hours/week) and diet quality (4.44/10), although there is room for improvement.
* Good sleep quality (8.18/10), which is essential for overall health and kidney function.

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 83/100

The risk score is determined based on various factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main points considered include:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: The presence of a family history of hypertension is a risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease.
2. **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of 163 mmHg is elevated, which increases the risk of CKD. Hypertension can damage the kidneys over time.
3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose is slightly elevated at 101.32032702130516 mg/dL, and the HbA1c is 8.412861353025537%, indicating poor glucose control, which is a risk factor for CKD.
4. **Creatinine and GFR**: The creatinine level is 2.475610703095423 mg/dL, and the GFR is 105.92761828950916 mL/min/1.73 m². Although the GFR is within a relatively normal range, the creatinine level is slightly elevated, suggesting some degree of kidney impairment.
5. **Protein in Urine (ACR)**: The ACR of 149.34142415355146 mg/g is significantly elevated, indicating proteinuria, a hallmark of kidney damage and a strong predictor of CKD progression.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's lifestyle, including smoking and high alcohol consumption (5.9119824996975705 units/week), can negatively impact kidney health.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (8.971378215476427 times/week) without the protection of medications like ACE inhibitors or statins, and suboptimal health behaviors (e.g., low health literacy, moderate medication adherence) may further increase the risk of CKD progression.

These factors collectively contribute to a high risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring of kidney function, lifestyle modifications, and possibly the introduction of renoprotective medications could help mitigate this risk.",83,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale (key points)
Factor
Impact on CKD risk
Evidence in your profile
Age (75 y)
Older age strongly predicts CKD progression.
Highest age bracket in the dataset.
Race – Black
Higher prevalence of hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy.
Identified in personal data.
Blood pressure
Systolic 163 mmHg is elevated; diastolic 64 mmHg indicates widened pulse pressure, a marker of arterial stiffness.
>140/90 threshold for hypertension.
Diabetes control
HbA1c 8.4 % indicates poor glycemic control, accelerating kidney damage.
No antidiabetic meds despite high HbA1c.
Proteinuria (2.22 g/day)
Macro‑proteinuria is a hallmark of active kidney injury.
>1 g/day is high and associated with faster decline.
Albumin‑creatinine ratio (149 mg/g)
Above 30 mg/g but below 300 mg/g → moderate risk; trending towards higher stages if persists.
Shows ongoing glomerular damage.
NSAID use (9 ×/wk)
Repeated NSAID exposure can cause acute and chronic renal injury.
Near upper limit of weekly use.
Lifestyle – smoking, low physical activity
Both increase cardiovascular and renal risk.
Smoking status positive, activity low.
Other labs
Mild hypertriglyceridemia, normal electrolytes; hemoglobin high (possible dehydration or erythrocytosis).
Not a direct risk but suggests underlying conditions.
Symptoms – fatigue, nausea, itching, cramps
Often reflect worsening kidney function or electrolyte imbalance.
Frequency and intensity high.
Health behaviors
Moderate check‑up frequency, low medication adherence and health literacy could delay early intervention.
Scores <3 for checkups, <1 for adherence.
Combining these factors in a weighted, point‑based manner (age + race + BP + diabetes + proteinuria + NSAIDs + lifestyle) yields an overall CKD risk of ≈ 78 %. This suggests a moderate‑to‑high likelihood of progressive chronic kidney disease and warrants urgent nephrology evaluation, tighter BP and glucose control, cessation of NSAIDs, and routine monitoring of eGFR and albuminuria.

Category
Finding
Impact on CKD risk
Age / Demographics
75 y, Hispanic, high SES
Age >70 is a strong independent risk factor; ethnicity adds modest risk.
Blood pressure
163/64 mmHg
Systolic >140 mmHg strongly increases progression risk; diastolic is low but isolated systolic hypertension is still concerning.
Glycaemic status
Fasting glucose 101 mg/dL, HbA1c 8.4 %
Indicates uncontrolled pre‑diabetes/diabetes, a major CKD driver.
Renal biomarkers
Creatinine 2.48 mg/dL, GFR 106 mL/min/1.73 m² (likely a calculation artifact), Proteinuria 2.22 g/day, ACR 149 mg/g
Heavy proteinuria and an ACR >100 mg/g are classic markers of ongoing glomerular injury; high creatinine suggests decreased filtration despite the GFR figure.
Medication & exposure
NSAID use ~9×/wk
Chronic NSAID exposure is a well‑known nephrotoxic risk.
Lifestyle
Smoking (yes), alcohol 6 units/wk, low physical activity
Smoking adds vascular risk; alcohol and sedentary habits further contribute to hypertension and metabolic derangements.
Symptoms
Fatigue, itching, frequent nausea/vomiting
Reflects possible uremic sequelae and early CKD symptomatology.
Other labs
Hyper‑triglyceridemia, high LDL/HDL ratio
Dyslipidemia accelerates atherosclerotic renal vascular disease.
Combining these high‑impact factors yields a high CKD risk score of 82/100, indicating that the patient is at significant risk for progression to advanced CKD if current factors remain uncontrolled. Immediate nephrology referral, stricter blood‑pressure and glucose control, cessation of NSAIDs, and lifestyle modification are strongly advised.

The high risk score is primarily due to a combination of factors including:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Your yes to family history of hypertension increases the risk.
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (127/117 mmHg) is a significant risk factor.
3. **Kidney Function Indicators**: Elevated creatinine (1.794401988616538 mg/dL) and reduced GFR (28.803078672212525 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate compromised kidney function.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in urine (2.840533315454805 g/day) and a high ACR (50.06677169371569 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
5. **Previous UTIs**: A history of urinary tract infections can increase the risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While your diet quality is somewhat acceptable, your smoking habit and moderate alcohol consumption are risk factors.
7. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: While not in the diabetic range, your fasting glucose (138.53363872512304 mg/dL) and HbA1c (4.8789935987068604%) levels are on the higher side, suggesting prediabetic conditions which can contribute to kidney disease risk.
8. **Medications and NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (7.363046920393623 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function over time.

However, factors like your high physical activity level, good sleep quality, and relatively low BMI (19.63529544567935) may slightly mitigate the risk. Regular medical checkups and high medication adherence are also positive factors. Despite these, the presence of several significant risk factors elevates your overall risk score for chronic kidney disease.",83,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 78/100**

The calculated risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and clinical parameters. The main points contributing to this high risk score include:

*   **Family History:** Presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes, which are significant risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
*   **Clinical Parameters:** Elevated fasting glucose (198.17240360887055 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.576805263728835%) levels, indicating poor glucose control. Additionally, the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is 24.677604552898543 mL/min/1.73 m², which falls into the category of severe chronic kidney disease.
*   **Electrolytes and Kidney Function:** High levels of creatinine (3.3074741980582005 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (13.400329198808349 mg/dL), along with significant proteinuria (3.677110227423945 g/day) and an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (47.19557818838107 mg/g), all indicating compromised kidney function.
*   **Lifestyle Factors:** Although the diet quality is reported as 0.1495799459343549/10, suggesting a very poor diet, the physical activity level is high (9.711744051399585 hours/week), which is a positive factor. However, the overall impact of diet and other lifestyle factors on kidney health cannot be ignored.
*   **Medications and Symptoms:** Frequent use of NSAIDs (9.816816942349632 times/week) can be nephrotoxic and may exacerbate kidney disease, especially in the absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics. Symptoms such as fatigue (8.58935824585478/10), nausea/vomiting (5.935992654546926 times/week), muscle cramps (4.689515085921315 times/week), and itching (8.45031600224057/10) suggest a significant impact on quality of life and possible uremic symptoms.
*   **Health Behaviors:** Infrequent medical checkups (0.651017521737085/year) and low medication adherence (1.1112532375034734/10) may hinder the management of CKD risk factors",83,Asian,Caucasian,"Risk Score: 88/100

The high risk score for chronic kidney disease is based on several key factors:

* **Family history**: Presence of hypertension and diabetes in the family increases the risk.
* **Kidney function**: Low GFR (24.67 mL/min/1.73 m²) and high Creatinine (3.307 mg/dL) levels indicate impaired kidney function.
* **Proteinuria**: High levels of protein in urine (3.677 g/day) and elevated ACR (47.195 mg/g) suggest kidney damage.
* **Blood pressure**: Although current blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, the presence of family hypertension history and potential for uncontrolled blood pressure in the past contributes to the risk.
* **Blood glucose**: Elevated fasting glucose (198.172 mg/dL) and HbA1c (5.576%) levels, despite not being extremely high, in the context of a family history of diabetes, are concerning.
* **Electrolytes and related factors**: The slight elevation in potassium (5.024 mEq/L) and the presence of high triglycerides (348.479 mg/dL) and total cholesterol (222.967 mg/dL) can also impact kidney health.
* **Symptoms and quality of life**: Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, itching, and a reduced quality of life score (55.773) may indicate chronic kidney disease's impact on overall health.
* **Medications and health behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs (9.816 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially without the protective use of ACE inhibitors or other kidney-protective medications. Low medication adherence (1.111/10) and limited medical checkups (0.651/year) may exacerbate the risk due to potential gaps in management of underlying conditions.

These factors cumulatively contribute to a high risk score, indicating a need for closer monitoring and management of kidney health, as well as addressing modifiable risk factors such as diet, physical activity, and medication adherence.",87,Asian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

The calculated risk score of 87/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is based on several key factors from the provided information:

1. **Family History**: The presence of family history of hypertension and diabetes are significant risk factors for CKD, as these conditions can lead to kidney damage over time.
2. **Previous Health Issues**: The patient has had urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can increase the risk of CKD if they lead to recurrent kidney infections or if they are a sign of an underlying urinary tract issue that could impact kidney function.
3. **Blood Pressure**: While the current blood pressure (118/80 mmHg) is within a relatively normal range, the family history of hypertension suggests a potential risk for future hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The elevated fasting glucose (198.17240360887055 mg/dL) and slightly elevated HbA1c (5.576805263728835%) suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for diabetes and, by extension, CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The patient's creatinine level (3.3074741980582005 mg/dL) and GFR (24.677604552898543 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate impaired kidney function. The GFR is significantly below the normal range (which is generally considered to be above 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), suggesting at least stage 3 CKD.
6. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (3.677110227423945 g/day) and an elevated ACR (47.19557818838107 mg/g) are direct indicators of kidney damage, as healthy kidneys do not allow significant amounts of protein to pass into the urine.
7. **Electrolytes and Other Lab Values**: Elevated potassium levels can be associated with kidney disease, as the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance.
8. **Lifestyle and Medications**: The use of NSAIDs (9.816816942349632 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term use or in high doses, as NSAIDs can reduce blood flow to the kidneys.

Given these factors, particularly the existing impaired kidney function (low GFR), proteinuria, and potential risk",87,Asian,Black,"Risk Score: 75/100
Rationale
Renal Function – GFR of 24.7mL/min/1.73 m
2
 places the patient in CKD stage 3b; creatinine of 3.3mg/dL and proteinuria of 3.7g/day strongly indicate established kidney damage.
Proteinuria & Albumin‑creatinine Ratio – ACR of 47mg/g (moderate) and heavy albuminuria contribute to a high likelihood of progressive disease.
Diabetes & Glycemic Control – Fasting glucose of 198mg/dL (hyperglycemia) with a borderline HbA1c of 5.6% suggests inadequate long‑term glycemic control, a known accelerator of CKD progression.
Blood Pressure & Hypertension History – Normal systolic/diastolic BP now (118/80 mmHg) but a strong family history of hypertension adds risk, especially in the context of existing renal impairment.
Medications & Exposures – Near‑weekly NSAID use (~10 days/week) can further worsen kidney function; absence of ACE inhibitors or diuretics limits protective pharmacologic management.
Lifestyle & Socio‑economic Factors – High physical activity and good sleep quality are protective, yet a very low diet quality score (0.15/10) and moderate alcohol intake (≈7.7 units/week) may offset these benefits.
Symptoms & Quality of Life – Severe fatigue (8.6/10) and itching (8.4/10), common in advanced CKD, corroborate the high risk assessment.
Taken together, the combination of low eGFR, significant proteinuria, hyperglycemia, NSAID exposure, and suboptimal lifestyle factors yields a moderate‑to‑high risk of CKD progression, reflected in the 75/100 score.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, lifestyle, and health behaviors. The main points contributing to this score are:

* Family history of hypertension, which increases the risk of developing kidney disease
* Elevated systolic blood pressure (132 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (75 mmHg), which can damage kidney function over time
* High creatinine level (2.89 mg/dL) and protein in urine (2.38 g/day), indicating impaired kidney function
* Reduced GFR (78.14 mL/min/1.73 m²), suggesting kidney damage
* Poor water quality, which may expose you to contaminants that can harm kidney health
* High sodium and phosphorus levels, which can worsen kidney function
* Use of NSAIDs (5 times/week), which can be harmful to kidney function if taken excessively
* Presence of symptoms such as fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, which may indicate kidney disease progression
* Poor QoL score (53.29/100), which may be related to underlying kidney disease

However, some factors reduce the risk score, including:
* No family history of kidney disease or diabetes
* No previous AKI or UTIs
* Good medication adherence and health literacy
* Regular medical checkups (2.07 times/year)
* Use of statins, which may help reduce cardiovascular risk factors associated with kidney disease

Can you give me a risk score for chronic kidney disease, out of 100? Give me the risk score formatted as 'Risk Score: <value>/100' and a brief rationale with main points.","Risk Score: 73/100

The risk score of 73/100 for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily driven by several key factors:

1. **Family History of Hypertension**: Having a family history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for CKD, as hypertension is a leading cause of kidney disease.
2. **Elevated Creatinine and BUN Levels**: The higher levels of creatinine (2.89 mg/dL) and BUN (19.73 mg/dL) indicate impaired kidney function. Although the GFR is within a relatively normal range (78.14 mL/min/1.73 m²), these values in conjunction suggest some level of kidney impairment.
3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of protein in the urine (2.38 g/day) is a marker of kidney damage, which is a significant risk factor for CKD progression.
4. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure of 132 mmHg, while not severely elevated, is on the higher end of normal and, when combined with other factors, contributes to the risk score.
5. **Lifestyle and Medications**: The use of NSAIDs (4.97 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, especially with long-term use. The lack of ACE inhibitors, which are protective of kidney function, also plays a role.
6. **Symptoms**: The presence of muscle cramps, itching, and some level of fatigue may indicate early symptoms of kidney dysfunction, although these can also be attributed to other causes.

However, factors mitigating the risk include:
- **No Family History of Kidney Disease or Diabetes**: This reduces the genetic predisposition to CKD.
- **Good Diet Quality and Physical Activity**: These lifestyle choices can help manage blood pressure and reduce CKD risk.
- **High Health Literacy and Regular Medical Checkups**: Being informed about health and regularly attending checkups can lead to better management of risk factors.

Overall, while there are significant risk factors at play, the absence of certain other risks and the presence of positive health behaviors somewhat mitigate the score, resulting in a risk score of 73/100. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure, proteinuria, and adherence to beneficial lifestyle choices are crucial to preventing CKD progression.",73,Caucasian,Black,"**Risk Score: 88/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several key factors:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease in this case, other medical history and current health indicators play a significant role in the risk assessment.

2. **Hypertension**: The systolic blood pressure is elevated at 172 mmHg, which is a significant risk factor for CKD. High blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time.

3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: The fasting glucose is 136.01983091914062 mg/dL, and HbA1c is 6.853352428750819%, indicating impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.

4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The serum creatinine is within the normal range, but the GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) at 79.28733579205712 mL/min/1.73 m², although within the normal range, is on the lower end for someone without other risk factors. The protein in urine (3.523863896219987 g/day) and ACR (Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio) of 118.1278413871878 mg/g are elevated, indicating kidney damage.

5. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of NSAIDs, even though not frequent, can be harmful to kidney function over time. The patient is on statins, which can have mixed effects on kidney function but are generally not harmful. Low adherence to medication and lower health literacy are also concerning as they can lead to inadequate management of risk factors.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps could be indicative of underlying kidney issues, although these symptoms can also stem from other conditions.

7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's BMI, alcohol consumption, and physical activity levels are not significantly contributing to the risk in this scenario, given the other dominant factors.

In summary, this patient's elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose regulation, signs of kidney damage (proteinuria and elevated ACR), and certain lifestyle and medication adherence issues contribute to a higher risk score for chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring of kidney function, strict blood pressure control, and management of glucose levels, along with lifestyle modifications and improvement",73,Caucasian,Caucasian,"**Risk Score: 68/100**

**Rationale**

- **Blood pressure** – Systolic 172 mmHg is markedly elevated and a major driver of kidney damage.  
- **Proteinuria** – 3.5 g/day and ACR 118 mg/g are above normal thresholds, indicating significant glomerular injury.  
- **Diabetes markers** – Fasting glucose 136 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.85 % place her in the pre‑diabetes/early‑diabetes range, increasing CKD progression risk.  
- **Renal function** – GFR 79 mL/min/1.73 m² is in CKD stage 2; the presence of proteinuria and hypertension heighten progression likelihood.

The risk score is determined based on several key factors from the provided medical history and current health status. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes reduces the risk.
2. **Previous AKI and UTIs**: The presence of UTIs but no previous Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has a mixed effect, with UTIs potentially increasing the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) over time.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic blood pressure (172 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD, as high blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels.
4. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: Elevated fasting glucose (136.01983091914062 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.853352428750819%) levels indicate impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for CKD.
5. **Kidney Function Tests**: The GFR (79.28733579205712 mL/min/1.73 m²) is within the normal range but on the lower end, and the presence of protein in urine (3.523863896219987 g/day) with an elevated ACR (118.1278413871878 mg/g) indicates kidney damage.
6. **Electrolytes and Lipids**: The levels of electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, as well as lipid profiles, are mostly within normal ranges but require monitoring due to their potential impact on kidney health and cardiovascular risk.
7. **Medications and Health Behaviors**: The use of statins is beneficial for managing cholesterol levels, but the limited use of NSAIDs and the lack of adherence to certain health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, health literacy) could negatively affect kidney health.
8. **Quality of Life and Symptoms**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, along with a moderate QoL score, suggests some impact on daily life that could be related to or exacerbated by kidney health.

Given these factors, the calculated risk score reflects a heightened risk of developing or progressing chronic kidney disease, necessitating close monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and potentially therapeutic interventions to mitigate risk factors.",73,Caucasian,Asian,"Risk Score: **78/100**

The provided risk score is based on the combination of various factors related to the patient's medical history, lifestyle, and current health conditions. The main points contributing to this risk score include:

1. **Family History and Medications**: Although there's no family history of kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, the use of NSAIDs (1.7477453367580364 times/week) can be a risk factor for kidney damage over time. The absence of protective medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics, which could help manage conditions like hypertension or proteinuria, also plays a role.

2. **Blood Pressure**: The patient's systolic blood pressure (172 mmHg) is elevated, which is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). High blood pressure can damage kidney blood vessels, reducing their ability to function properly.

3. **Fasting Glucose and HbA1c**: The fasting glucose level (136.01983091914062 mg/dL) and HbA1c (6.853352428750819%) are slightly elevated, indicating impaired glucose regulation. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD, but these values, while concerning, are not in the diabetic range. However, they suggest prediabetes, which can still increase the risk of developing CKD.

4. **Kidney Function Tests**: The creatinine level (0.5320737627287953 mg/dL) and GFR (79.28733579205712 mL/min/1.73 m²) indicate relatively preserved kidney function. However, the presence of protein in the urine (3.523863896219987 g/day) and an elevated ACR (118.1278413871878 mg/g) are significant indicators of kidney damage.

5. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient's diet quality (6.2479570733386245/10), while not poor, could be improved. Physical activity (7.527929211954386 hours/week) is good. The alcohol consumption (17.659509996617942 units/week) is also relatively moderate but should be monitored.

6. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and muscle cramps, although not extremely high, combined with a relatively low quality of life score (41.93829783791647/100), may indicate underlying health issues that could impact",74,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Age & Ethnicity: At 66 y and Black, baseline risk for CKD is elevated.
Blood Pressure: Systolic 172 mmHg is markedly high; diastolic 65 mmHg is low, indicating a widened pulse pressure that accelerates renal damage.
Proteinuria & ACR: 3.5 g/day and 118 mg/g ACR fall in the moderate (ACR 30‑299 mg/g) to heavy proteinuria range, a strong predictor of progressive CKD.
Glucose Metabolism: Fasting glucose 136 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.85 % point to impaired glucose tolerance; hyperglycaemia contributes to nephron injury.
Medication & Lifestyle: Frequent NSAID use (≈2×/wk) and low medication adherence (0.2/10) further heighten renal insult.
Renal Function: Current eGFR of 79 mL/min/1.73 m² is normal‑mildly decreased, but the presence of significant albuminuria suggests early structural damage.
Other Factors: Low socioeconomic status, low health literacy, and a history of UTIs add cumulative risk.
Combining these elements places the patient in a high‑intermediate risk category for chronic kidney disease progression.

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is elevated due to several key factors. The main points contributing to this score include:

1. **Elevated Blood Pressure**: Systolic BP of 172 mmHg is significantly higher than the normal range, indicating hypertension, which is a major risk factor for CKD.

2. **Impaired Fasting Glucose and HbA1c Levels**: A fasting glucose level of 136 mg/dL and an HbA1c of 6.853% suggest impaired glucose regulation, which is a risk factor for developing kidney disease.

3. **Protein in Urine (Proteinuria)**: The presence of 3.523863896219987 g/day of protein in the urine, along with an Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) of 118.1278413871878 mg/g, indicates kidney damage, a direct sign of CKD.

4. **Family History and Previous Kidney Issues**: Although there's no reported family history of kidney disease or previous AKI, the patient does have a history of UTIs, which can increase the risk of developing CKD.

5. **Lifestyle and Health Behaviors**: The patient's alcohol consumption, while not excessively high, and relatively low physical activity level may contribute to the risk. The quality of diet and sleep, although not severely impaired, are not optimal, which can indirectly affect kidney health.

6. **Medications and Health Management**: The use of NSAIDs, despite being occasional, can potentially harm kidney function over time. The lack of adherence to medication and lower health literacy may hinder effective management of existing conditions that could impact kidney health.

7. **Laboratory Values**: The slightly elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with the GFR of 79 mL/min/1.73 m², suggest some level of kidney function impairment, though not severely decreased. Electrolyte and cholesterol levels, while largely within normal ranges, contribute to the overall vascular and metabolic health that can impact CKD risk.

**Rationale – Key Points**  
1. **Hypertension** – Systolic BP 172 mmHg (very high for a 66‑year‑old) strongly accelerates CKD progression.  
2. **Proteinuria & ACR** – 3.5 g/day protein and ACR 118 mg/g exceed the thresholds for significant renal damage (ACR >30 mg/g).  
3. **Reduced GFR** – A GFR of ~79 mL/min/1.73 m² falls into Stage 2 CKD; with the above proteinuria the disease is likely already progressing.  
4. **Hyperglycemia / Prediabetes** – Fasting glucose 136 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.85 % indicate impaired glucose tolerance, increasing risk for diabetic kidney damage.

The risk score is based on the provided medical history, laboratory results, and lifestyle factors. Main points that contribute to this score include:

1. **Family History of Kidney Disease and Hypertension**: A positive family history of kidney disease and hypertension increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. **Hypertension**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (141/106 mmHg) is a significant risk factor for CKD.
3. **Reduced GFR**: A GFR of 57.95 mL/min/1.73 m² indicates impaired kidney function, which is a direct indicator of CKD.
4. **Proteinuria**: The presence of protein in the urine (1.5002541804190372 g/day) and an elevated ACR (46.19716389430065 mg/g) are markers of kidney damage.
5. **Electrolyte Imbalance and Hemoglobin Levels**: Although electrolyte levels are largely within normal ranges, slightly elevated sodium and low-normal phosphorus levels, along with a hemoglobin level of 12.93 g/dL, may indicate early signs of kidney dysfunction affecting mineral and blood cell regulation.
6. **Medications and NSAIDs Use**: Frequent use of NSAIDs (4.635740748191478 times/week) can increase the risk of kidney damage over time.
7. **Lifestyle Factors**: The diet quality score of 1.257149077846762/10 suggests a poor diet, which can negatively impact kidney health. High alcohol consumption (12.521190628856582 units/week) also poses health risks, including to kidney function.
8. **Symptoms and Quality of Life**: The presence of fatigue, nausea/vomiting, muscle cramps, and itching, although not extreme, alongside a moderate quality of life score (76.80005531665674/100), may reflect the onset of symptoms associated with CKD.
9. **Exposures and Health Behaviors**: Poor water quality and relatively low adherence to medication (3.487424225453241/10) could further increase the risk of developing or worsening CKD.

Considering these factors, the risk of developing or having chronic kidney disease is significantly elevated. Regular monitoring, lifestyle adjustments, and possibly intervention are recommended to manage and potentially reduce this risk.",74,Caucasian,Asian,"**Risk Score: 82/100**

The risk score for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is relatively high due to several factors. Main points include:

1. **Family History**: Presence of family kidney disease and hypertension, which are significant risk factors for CKD.
2. **Blood Pressure**: Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (141/106 mmHg) increases the risk of kidney damage.
3. **Kidney Function**: Indicators such as creatinine (4.816464226854171 mg/dL) and GFR (57.95081503782567 mL/min/1.73 m²) suggest impaired kidney function.
4. **Protein in Urine**: The presence of protein in urine (1.5002541804190372 g/day) and an elevated ACR (46.19716389430065 mg/g) are indicative of kidney damage.
5. **Medications and Exposures**: Use of NSAIDs (4.635740748191478 times/week) can be harmful to kidney function, and poor water quality may also contribute to the risk.
6. **Lifestyle Factors**: While the BMI is within a relatively healthy range, the diet quality is low (1.257149077846762/10), which can negatively affect kidney health.
7. **Symptoms**: Presence of fatigue, muscle cramps, and itching, although not severe, can be indicative of underlying kidney issues.

However, factors such as no previous AKI, no UTIs, and relatively good sleep quality help to somewhat mitigate the risk. Additionally, a high socioeconomic status, high education level, and access to regular medical checkups (2.5205380697392905/year) can facilitate better management and monitoring of kidney health. Medication adherence and health literacy are also relatively good, which can positively impact disease management. Despite these mitigating factors, the presence of multiple risk factors contributes to a high risk score for CKD.",73,Caucasian,Black,"Risk Score: 78/100
Rationale
Renal function: Creatinine 4.8 mg/dL and GFR 58 mL/min/1.73 m² place the patient in CKD stage 3b, indicating moderate kidney damage.
Proteinuria: 1.5 g/day and ACR 46 mg/g are above normal limits, signifying significant glomerular injury.
Hypertension: Systolic 141 mmHg and diastolic 106 mmHg (stage 2) are major drivers of progressive kidney loss, especially in a Black patient who is at higher baseline risk.
Glycemic control: HbA1c 8.6 % is markedly elevated, suggesting pre‑diabetes/diabetes, which accelerates CKD progression.
Family history: Positive for kidney disease and hypertension increases inherited susceptibility.
Lifestyle: NSAID use ≈5 × week and poor water quality may contribute to renal insult; high BMI (≈25) adds modest risk.
Other markers: Mild hyperlipidemia (LDL 110 mg/dL, HDL 90 mg/dL) and normal electrolytes indicate no immediate crisis but do not offset the above risks.
Combining these factors, the patient is at high risk for further kidney function decline, hence the 78/100 score.
